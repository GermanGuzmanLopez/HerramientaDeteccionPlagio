A wireless sensor network (WSN) constitutes a dispersed assemblage of small, energy-efficient wireless devices deployed within a physical setting to oversee diverse environmental circumstances. Information gathered by these strategically positioned sensor nodes is relayed via multi-hop communications to designated nodes. WSNs boast numerous benefits compared to alternative networks, such as increased adaptability, reduced expenses, and simplified deployment processes. Nonetheless, owing to the inherent limitations of WSNs, they confront various challenges and concerns that necessitate resolution to ensure dependable and secure data transmission. WSN nodes are particularly susceptible to different forms of security breaches, including black hole attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) incidents, and node compromise attempts. Among these threats, black hole attacks pose a significant risk to network integrity. Perpetrated by malicious nodes, these attacks deliberately discard all data and control packets, failing to relay them to their intended recipients. To safeguard against black hole attacks, the development of an effective Intrusion Detection Technique capable of identifying malicious nodes is imperative. This study introduces a pioneering Fuzzy Logic-based Intrusion Detection System augmented with a Hidden Markov Model (FIDS-HMM) to pinpoint and counteract black hole attacks. Furthermore, the protocol integrates HMM to monitor node energy levels for enhanced detection of malicious nodes. The protocol's implementation is executed through the NS2 simulator, with simulation outcomes validating the efficacy of FIDS-HMM in detecting black hole attacks. Additionally, the proposed protocol demonstrates enhancements in Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, including packet delivery ratio, latency, and throughput, thereby bolstering network efficiency.
