An intelligent lighting system is a public lighting system that uses artificial intelligence technology to optimize energy management and improve the quality of lighting in public areas. This innovative approach not only reduces energy consumption but also enhances the safety and comfort of urban environments. This paper presents the use of two prominent artificial intelligence methods, namely fuzzy logic and neural networks, for intelligent power control in public lighting networks. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate performance of these approaches in optimizing power consumption and achieving efficient lighting, taking into consideration two parameters, namely road flow and weather conditions. By incorporating real-time data analysis, the system can adapt to varying conditions more effectively. To achieve this, the lighting system was modeled using the state flow tool in MATLAB/Simulink. Various algorithms based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were subsequently developed. Real data on traffic flow and cloud cover were utilized to train these algorithms. The training process involved extensive simulations to ensure accuracy and reliability. Upon analysis of the simulation results, it was observed that, overall, results closer to the algorithm based on fuzzy logic were yielded by algorithms based on neural networks. These findings highlight the potential for significant advancements in public lighting systems through the application of AI technologies.
