Interactive software agents, such as chatbots, are progressively being used in the area of health and well-being. These agents are designed to provide personalized support and improve user engagement in health-related activities. In such applications, where agents engage with users in interpersonal conversations for, e.g., coaching, comfort or behavior-change interventions, there is an increased need for understanding agents’ empathic capabilities. In the current state-of-the-art, there are no tools to do that. This gap highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions to evaluate and enhance empathy in digital interactions. In order to understand empathic capabilities in interactive software agents, we need a precise notion of empathy. The literature discusses a variety of definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus of a formal definition. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, a formal definition—an ontology—of empathy is developed. This ontology aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and measuring empathy in diverse contexts. We present the potential of the formal definition in a controlled user-study by applying it as a tool for assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots; Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition captures necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents, and how it can uncover and explain trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. Such insights are crucial for developing more effective and emotionally intelligent interactive agents. The definition, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), may serve as an automated tool, enabling systems to recognize empathy in interactions—be it an interactive agent evaluating its own empathic performance or an intelligent system assessing the empathic capability of its interlocutors.
