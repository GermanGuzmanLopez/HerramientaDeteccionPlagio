An intelligent lighting system is a public lighting system that uses artificial intelligence technology to optimize energy management and improve the quality of lighting in public areas. These systems are essential for modern urban infrastructure, providing sustainable and efficient lighting solutions. This paper presents the use of two prominent artificial intelligence methods, namely fuzzy logic and neural networks, for intelligent power control in public lighting networks. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate performance of these approaches in optimizing power consumption and achieving efficient lighting, taking into consideration two parameters, namely road flow and weather conditions. By incorporating adaptive control mechanisms, these systems can respond dynamically to changing environmental conditions. To achieve this, the lighting system was modeled using the state flow tool in MATLAB/Simulink. Various algorithms based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were subsequently developed. Real data on traffic flow and cloud cover were utilized to train these algorithms. The integration of these real-world datasets ensures that the algorithms are robust and reliable under diverse conditions. Upon analysis of the simulation results, it was observed that, overall, results closer to the algorithm based on fuzzy logic were yielded by algorithms based on neural networks. This finding underscores the potential for neural network-based approaches to enhance public lighting systems further.
