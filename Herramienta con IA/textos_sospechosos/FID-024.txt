Smart cities represent the convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) with urban management to improve the quality of life of city dwellers. These cities leverage advanced technologies to enhance sustainability, reduce energy consumption, and improve overall urban living conditions. In this context, recommender systems, tools that offer personalised suggestions to city dwellers, have emerged as key contributors to this convergence. Their successful application in various areas of city life and their ability to process massive amounts of data generated in urban environments has expedited their status as a crucial technology in the evolution of city planning. By utilizing big data analytics, these systems can provide more accurate and timely recommendations to citizens. Our methodology included reviewing the Web of Science database, resulting in 130 articles that, filtered for relevancy, were reduced to 86. This comprehensive review process ensures that only the most relevant and impactful studies are included in the analysis. The first stage consisted of carrying out a bibliometric analysis with the objective of analysing structural aspects with the SciMAT tool. Secondly, a systematic literature review was undertaken using the PRISMA 2020 statement. This dual approach allows for a thorough examination of existing research and identification of key trends and gaps. The results illustrated the different processes by which recommendations are filtered in areas such as tourism, health, mobility, and transport. These findings highlight the versatility and potential of recommender systems in enhancing various facets of urban life. This research is seen as a significant breakthrough that can drive the evolution and efficiency of smart cities, establishing a solid framework for future research in this dynamic field. Future studies can build upon this foundation to explore new applications and innovations in smart city technologies.
