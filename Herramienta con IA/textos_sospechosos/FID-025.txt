Surprisingly, the high accuracies previously reported, exceeding 95%, dropped significantly when faced with the more demanding conditions of the forensic scenario, plummeting to as low as 65%. This stark contrast underscores the limitations of current technologies when applied outside of controlled environments. In essence, while facial recognition systems have shown impressive performance in ideal conditions, our study indicates a substantial decrease in accuracy when faced with the complexities and challenges typical of real-world forensic scenarios, highlighting the need for further advancements to bridge this gap. Such findings are crucial for developing more reliable systems for law enforcement and security purposes. Recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision have shown facial recognition systems achieving accuracies that surpass human performance in controlled settings but fingerprint analysis is proved more accurate in all aspects. This comparison emphasizes the ongoing challenge of achieving consistent accuracy across different biometric modalities. To investigate this, we created a large-scale synthetic facial dataset and designed a controlled facial lineup that mimics conditions encountered in real forensic situations. This approach allowed us to systematically assess facial recognition under various challenging real-world conditions. Our methodology ensures a comprehensive evaluation of system performance under diverse scenarios. Using both our synthetic dataset and a well-known dataset of actual faces, we tested the accuracy of two widely used neural-based facial recognition systems. The results from these tests provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current technologies. Comparative and Analytical method is applied for present Research. This rigorous approach enhances the reliability of our findings and suggests pathways for future improvements. Artificial intelligence could help humans in accuracy and speeding up the process of investigation. Integrating AI into forensic analysis holds the promise of significantly enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of investigative processes.
