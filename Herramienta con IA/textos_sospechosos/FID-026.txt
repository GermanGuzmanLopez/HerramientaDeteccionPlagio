In the evolving landscape of human-computer interaction, this paper introduces an innovative framework poised to revolutionize chatbot systems. The increasing demand for more intuitive and responsive chatbots drives the need for continuous innovation in this field. Our framework, meticulously designed for emotionally aware multimodal chatbots, seamlessly integrates real-time face and emotion recognition with natural language processing. This integration enables the chatbot to respond more empathetically and accurately to user inputs. Currently in the developmental phase, the framework exhibits a distinctive proficiency in executing a diverse array of human instructions. These instructions span tasks such as generating detailed captions, object counting, and responding to general queries. Such versatility is critical for addressing the varied needs of users across different contexts. Leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning from OpenFlamingo, augmented by the inclusion of the Low-rank Adapter (LoRA), our framework strategically prioritizes versatility and operational efficiency. The core of our approach lies in the establishment of instruction templates that intricately merge both vision and language data. These templates are designed to enhance the chatbot's ability to interpret and respond to complex commands. This strategic integration forms the backbone of our multi-modality instruction tuning methodology, enhancing the adaptability of the chatbot. Recognizing the pivotal role of high-quality training data, we emphasize its significance in shaping the dialogue performance of the chatbot. High-quality data ensures that the chatbot can handle a wide range of scenarios effectively. As the framework progresses through its developmental stages, this research lays a robust foundation for the creation of a versatile conversational agent. The envisioned applications of this agent range from enhancing customer service experiences to providing valuable support in mental health scenarios. Such applications highlight the potential impact of advanced chatbot technologies on improving user engagement and support.
