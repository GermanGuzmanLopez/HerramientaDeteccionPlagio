Surprisingly, the high accuracies previously reported, exceeding 95%, dropped significantly when faced with the more demanding conditions of the forensic scenario, plummeting to as low as 65%. This dramatic drop in accuracy reveals the challenges faced by current technologies in real-world applications. In essence, while facial recognition systems have shown impressive performance in ideal conditions, our study indicates a substantial decrease in accuracy when faced with the complexities and challenges typical of real-world forensic scenarios, highlighting the need for further advancements to bridge this gap. These findings underscore the necessity for continuous innovation to improve reliability in diverse conditions. Recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision have shown facial recognition systems achieving accuracies that surpass human performance in controlled settings but fingerprint analysis is proved more accurate in all aspects. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant disparity in performance across different biometric methods. To investigate this, we created a large-scale synthetic facial dataset and designed a controlled facial lineup that mimics conditions encountered in real forensic situations. This approach allowed us to systematically assess facial recognition under various challenging real-world conditions. The rigorous testing conditions were essential for obtaining realistic performance metrics. Using both our synthetic dataset and a well-known dataset of actual faces, we tested the accuracy of two widely used neural-based facial recognition systems. These tests provided critical insights into the systems' operational strengths and weaknesses. Comparative and Analytical method is applied for present Research. Such comprehensive methodologies ensure robust and reliable findings. Artificial intelligence could help humans in accuracy and speeding up the process of investigation. Integrating AI into forensic processes could lead to faster and more precise investigative outcomes.
