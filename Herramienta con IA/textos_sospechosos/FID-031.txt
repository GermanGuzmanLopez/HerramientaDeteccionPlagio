Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted massive attention in many engineering and practical applications in the last years for their characteristics and operation flexibility. These versatile devices are revolutionizing sectors ranging from agriculture to emergency response. For the UAV system, suitable control systems are required to operate appropriately and efficiently. An emerging control technique is visual servoing utilizing the onboard camera systems for inspecting the UAV's environment and autonomously controlling the UAV's operation. This method significantly enhances the UAV's ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are widely deployed in the visual servoing of autonomous UAV applications. AI integration allows for more precise and adaptive control mechanisms. Despite the increasing research in the field of AI-based visual control of UAV systems, comprehensive review articles that showcase the general trends and future directions in this field of research are limited. Such reviews are essential for guiding future research efforts and identifying key innovation areas. This work comprehensively examines the application and advancements of AI-enhanced visual servoing in autonomous UAV systems, covering critical control tasks and offering insights into future research directions for enhancing performance and applicability which is limited in the current literature. The paper first reviews the application of intelligent visual servoing systems for autonomously executing various UAV control tasks, including 3D UAV positioning, aerial and ground object following, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous landing. These tasks are crucial for the effective deployment of UAVs in real-world scenarios. Second, the research progresses in applying AI techniques in the visual servoing of autonomous UAV systems are discussed and analyzed. This analysis highlights the potential and current limitations of AI in UAV applications. Finally, future directions and critical research gaps for further improving the performance and applicability of intelligent visual servoing systems are included. Addressing these gaps is vital for advancing UAV technology and expanding its practical applications.
