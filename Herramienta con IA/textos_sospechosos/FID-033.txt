Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated great expectations for the future impact of AI in education and learning (AIED). These advancements promise to revolutionize traditional educational models, offering personalized and adaptive learning experiences. Often these expectations have been based on misunderstanding current technical possibilities, lack of knowledge about state-of-the-art AI in education, and exceedingly narrow views on the functions of education in society. Such misconceptions can lead to unrealistic expectations and potential setbacks in implementing AI technologies effectively. In this article, we provide a review of existing AI systems in education and their pedagogic and educational assumptions. Our analysis includes a critical examination of the theoretical foundations underpinning these technologies. We develop a typology of AIED systems and describe different ways of using AI in education and learning, show how these are grounded in different interpretations of what AI and education is or could be, and discuss some potential roadblocks on the AIED highway. These roadblocks include issues related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for teacher training to effectively integrate AI tools in the classroom.
