Artificial intelligence is now a necessary component for both production and service systems in recent years, as technology has become a vital aspect of daily life. The integration of AI into various sectors is transforming the way we live and work, creating more efficient and innovative solutions. Automated driving vehicles operate autonomously, also known as driverless cars that can operate without a human driver. Research on autonomous vehicles has substantially advanced in recent years. This progress is driven by the need for safer and more reliable transportation options. Artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles are the current need of the society. These vehicles promise to revolutionize transportation by reducing human error and increasing road safety. Although some people might be apprehensive to give a computer control of their vehicle, automated driving technologies have the potential to make roads safer. The technology leverages advanced sensors and algorithms to navigate and respond to road conditions more effectively than humans. Self-driving automobiles can address environmental issues as well as safety-related ones. For example, they can optimize fuel consumption and reduce emissions through more efficient driving patterns. Unlike humans, computers do not really have difficulty keeping attention when driving. Additionally, by responding appropriately, an automated car can prevent accidents to potentially dangerous events on the road. This includes real-time adjustments to avoid collisions and handle sudden obstacles. Self-driving technology has many advantages, one of which will make more easily accessible means of transport to people who are unable to drive. For a variety of reasons, such as inexperience, incapacity, or age, many people are unable to operate a vehicle. These individuals can travel considerably more safely and independently. Such advancements in autonomous vehicles can significantly enhance mobility and quality of life for these populations. Therefore, we will explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars in this chapter, as well as their parts, benefits, and future developments. Understanding these components is crucial for further innovation and adoption of self-driving technologies.
