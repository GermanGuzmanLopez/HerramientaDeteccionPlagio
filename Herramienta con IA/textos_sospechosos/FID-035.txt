In this study, we explored the dynamic field of fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence (AI) in financial analysis from 1990 to 2023. This period saw significant technological advancements and a surge in AI applications in various domains. Utilizing the bibliometrix package in RStudio and data from the Web of Science, we focused on identifying mathematical models and the evolving role of fuzzy information granulation in this domain. These models are crucial for enhancing predictive accuracy and decision-making in financial contexts. The research addresses the urgent need to understand the development and impact of fuzzy logic and AI within the broader scope of evolving technological and analytical methodologies, particularly concentrating on their application in financial and banking contexts. This understanding is vital for leveraging AI to its full potential in financial industries. The bibliometric analysis involved an extensive review of the literature published during this period. We examined key metrics such as the annual growth rate, international collaboration, and average citations per document, which highlighted the field’s expansion and collaborative nature. These metrics provide a comprehensive overview of the research landscape and its evolution. The results revealed a significant annual growth rate of 19.54%, international collaboration of 21.16%, and an average citation per document of 25.52. Major journals such as IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, the Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, and Information Sciences emerged as significant contributors, aligning with Bradford’s Law’s Zone 1. The prominence of these journals underscores their influence in shaping the field. Notably, post-2020, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems showed a substantial increase in publications. This rise reflects growing interest and investment in fuzzy systems research. A significant finding was the high citation rate of seminal research on fuzzy information granulation, emphasizing its mathematical importance and practical relevance in financial analysis. Keywords like “design”, “model”, “algorithm”, “optimization”, “stabilization”, and terms such as “fuzzy logic controller”, “adaptive fuzzy controller”, and “fuzzy logic approach” were prevalent. These keywords indicate the diverse applications and innovative methods being developed. The Countries’ Collaboration World Map indicated a strong pattern of global interconnections, suggesting a robust framework of international collaboration. Such collaborations are essential for advancing the field and fostering innovation. Our study highlights the escalating influence of fuzzy logic and AI in financial analysis, marked by a growth in research outputs and global collaborations. It underscores the crucial role of fuzzy information granulation as a mathematical model and sets the stage for further investigation into how fuzzy logic and AI-driven models are transforming financial and banking analysis practices worldwide. This transformation is paving the way for more accurate and efficient financial strategies.
