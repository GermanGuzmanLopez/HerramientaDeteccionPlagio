Artificial intelligence is now a necessary component for both production and service systems in recent years, as technology has become a vital aspect of daily life. Its integration into various sectors has significantly enhanced efficiency and innovation. Automated driving vehicles operate autonomously, also known as driverless cars that can operate without a human driver. These vehicles are equipped with advanced sensors and AI algorithms to navigate roads safely. Research on autonomous vehicles has substantially advanced in recent years. This progress is evident in the increased deployment of test vehicles and pilot projects worldwide. Artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles are the current need of the society. Their potential to transform transportation systems makes them a critical area of study. Although some people might be apprehensive to give a computer control of their vehicle, automated driving technologies have the potential to make roads safer. Extensive testing and safety protocols are in place to ensure these vehicles can handle various driving conditions. Self-driving automobiles can address environmental issues as well as safety-related ones. By optimizing driving patterns, they can reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Unlike humans, computers do not really have difficulty keeping attention when driving. Additionally, by responding appropriately, an automated car can prevent accidents to potentially dangerous events on the road. Their ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows for quick and accurate decision-making. Self-driving technology has many advantages, one of which will make more easily accessible means of transport to people who are unable to drive. For a variety of reasons, such as inexperience, incapacity, or age, many people are unable to operate a vehicle. These individuals can travel considerably more safely and independently. This increased mobility can improve quality of life and access to essential services. Therefore, we will explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars in this chapter, as well as their parts, benefits, and future developments. Understanding these components is crucial for advancing autonomous vehicle technology and addressing its challenges.
