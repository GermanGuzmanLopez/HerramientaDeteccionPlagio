Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted massive attention in many engineering and practical applications in the last years for their characteristics and operation flexibility. Their ability to perform a wide range of tasks with high efficiency has made them indispensable in various industries. For the UAV system, suitable control systems are required to operate appropriately and efficiently. Effective control mechanisms are essential to ensure optimal performance and reliability. An emerging control technique is visual servoing utilizing the onboard camera systems for inspecting the UAV's environment and autonomously controlling the UAV's operation. This method leverages visual data to navigate and manage the UAV's activities autonomously. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are widely deployed in the visual servoing of autonomous UAV applications. AI-driven approaches enable more sophisticated and adaptive control strategies. Despite the increasing research in the field of AI-based visual control of UAV systems, comprehensive review articles that showcase the general trends and future directions in this field of research are limited. There is a noticeable lack of comprehensive reviews that outline the overarching trends and future prospects in this area. This work comprehensively examines the application and advancements of AI-enhanced visual servoing in autonomous UAV systems, covering critical control tasks and offering insights into future research directions for enhancing performance and applicability which is limited in the current literature. This study provides a detailed exploration of the advancements in AI-enhanced visual servoing for UAVs, addressing key control tasks and suggesting future research pathways. The paper first reviews the application of intelligent visual servoing systems for autonomously executing various UAV control tasks, including 3D UAV positioning, aerial and ground object following, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous landing. Initially, it reviews the use of smart visual servoing systems for autonomously performing various UAV control operations, such as 3D positioning, following aerial and ground targets, avoiding obstacles, and landing autonomously. Second, the research progresses in applying AI techniques in the visual servoing of autonomous UAV systems are discussed and analyzed. Next, the advancements in applying AI methods to the visual control of autonomous UAVs are examined and evaluated. Finally, future directions and critical research gaps for further improving the performance and applicability of intelligent visual servoing systems are included. Lastly, the paper identifies future research directions and key gaps that need to be addressed to further enhance the performance and applicability of intelligent visual servoing systems.
