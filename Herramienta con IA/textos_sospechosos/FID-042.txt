This article examines benefits and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education in relation to fundamental human rights. It explores how AI integration in education intersects with basic human rights principles. The article is based on an EU scoping study [Berendt, B., A. Littlejohn, P. Kern, P. Mitros, X. Shacklock, and M. Blakemore. 2017. Big Data for Monitoring Educational Systems. Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union. https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/]. This study evaluates the role of AI and big data in enhancing the real-time monitoring of educational systems. The study takes into account the potential for AI and ‘Big Data’ to provide more effective monitoring of the education system in real-time, but also considers the implications for fundamental human rights and freedoms of both teachers and learners. It also examines how these technologies impact the privacy and autonomy of educators and students. The analysis highlights a need to balance the benefits and risks as AI tools are developed, marketed and deployed. Striking this balance is crucial to protect individual rights while harnessing the benefits of AI. We conclude with a call to embed consideration of the benefits and risks of AI in education as technology tools into the development, marketing and deployment of these tools. Incorporating these considerations early in the development process can lead to more ethical and effective AI applications in education. There are questions around who – which body or organisation – should take responsibility for regulating AI in education, particularly since AI impacts not only data protection and privacy, but on fundamental rights in general. Determining the regulatory authority for AI in education is complex, given its broad impact on fundamental rights beyond just data privacy. Given AI’s global impact, it should be regulated at a trans-national level, with a global organisation such as the UN taking on this role. A trans-national regulatory framework, possibly under the auspices of the UN, is essential for addressing the global implications of AI in education.
