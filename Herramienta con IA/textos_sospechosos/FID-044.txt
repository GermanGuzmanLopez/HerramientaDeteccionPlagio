Artificial intelligence chatbots have invaded the tourism industry owing to their low cost and high efficiency. Their widespread adoption is driven by their ability to provide cost-effective and efficient customer interactions. However, the influence of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes has not received much attention from researchers. Despite their prevalence, the impact of chatbots' emotional cues on customer experiences remains underexplored. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, we explored how emotional expressions of chatbots affect customer satisfaction using three experiments in the context of tourist attraction recommendations. Using expectancy violations theory as a framework, we conducted three experiments to examine the effect of chatbots' emotional displays on customer satisfaction within the realm of tourist attraction recommendations. Chatbots' expressions of concern for customers can improve customer satisfaction by reducing expectancy violations. When chatbots show empathy, it can enhance customer satisfaction by aligning with customer expectations. In particular, customer's goal orientation, the human-likeness of chatbot's avatars, and the relationship type between customers and chatbots can moderate the negative relationship between emotional expression and expectancy violation. Factors such as customer goals, the human-like appearance of chatbot avatars, and the nature of the customer-chatbot relationship can influence how emotional expressions are perceived. These findings advance research on the emotional expressions of chatbots and provide critical insights for deploying chatbots in customer service in the tourism industry. These insights contribute to the understanding of chatbot emotionality and offer valuable guidelines for implementing chatbots in the tourism sector.
