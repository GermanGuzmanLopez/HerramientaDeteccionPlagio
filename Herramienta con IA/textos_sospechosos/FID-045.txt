Background:
There is a dearth of feasibility assessments regarding using large language models (LLMs) for responding to inquiries from autistic patients within a Chinese-language context. Although Chinese is one of the most spoken languages worldwide, most research on the application of these models in the medical domain has concentrated on English-speaking populations.

Objective:
This study aims to assess the effectiveness of LLM chatbots, specifically ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) and ERNIE Bot (version 2.2.3; Baidu, Inc), one of the most advanced LLMs in China, in addressing inquiries from autistic individuals in a Chinese setting. The goal is to determine how well these AI models can handle questions from autistic patients within the Chinese language environment.

Methods:
For this study, we gathered data from DXYâ€”a widely acknowledged, web-based, medical consultation platform in China with a user base of over 100 million individuals. Data were collected from DXY, a prominent online medical consultation service in China, known for its extensive user base exceeding 100 million. A total of 100 patient consultation samples were rigorously selected from January 2018 to August 2023, amounting to 239 questions extracted from publicly available autism-related documents on the platform. We meticulously selected 100 consultation samples from January 2018 to August 2023, yielding 239 questions sourced from publicly accessible autism-related records. To maintain objectivity, both the original questions and responses were anonymized and randomized. For objectivity, all questions and responses were anonymized and randomized. An evaluation team of 3 chief physicians assessed the responses across 4 dimensions: relevance, accuracy, usefulness, and empathy. A team of three chief physicians evaluated the responses based on relevance, accuracy, usefulness, and empathy. The team completed 717 evaluations. In total, 717 evaluations were conducted by the team. The team initially identified the best response and then used a Likert scale with 5 response categories to gauge the responses, each representing a distinct level of quality. Responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with each point representing a different quality level, after identifying the best response. Finally, we compared the responses collected from different sources. Finally, responses from various sources were compared to determine overall effectiveness.
