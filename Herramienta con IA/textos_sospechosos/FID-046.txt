Throughout the last decades, the number of vehicles on the road has steadily increased due to the rising demand for urban mobility and contemporary logistics. The growing need for urban transportation and modern logistics has led to a steady increase in the number of vehicles on the road over the past few decades. Two of the many detrimental effects of more vehicles on the road, which also impede economic development, are increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents. This surge in vehicles has resulted in greater traffic congestion and a higher incidence of traffic accidents, both of which hinder economic progress. The issues mentioned above can be significantly resolved by making vehicles smarter by reducing their reliance on humans. Making vehicles more intelligent and less dependent on human drivers can substantially alleviate these problems. Over the past century, various nations have conducted extensive research that has fueled the automation of road vehicles. Extensive research conducted by numerous countries over the last century has advanced the automation of road vehicles. The development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is currently being pursued by all significant motor manufacturers worldwide. Major automotive manufacturers around the globe are now actively developing autonomous vehicle technologies. Undoubtedly, the widespread use of autonomous cars is more imminent than we realize given the development of artificial intelligence (AI). With advancements in artificial intelligence, the widespread adoption of autonomous cars is closer than we might think. In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings and make the right decisions in real time, AI has emerged as a crucial component. AI has become essential for autonomous vehicles to understand their environment and make real-time decisions. This development of AI is being driven by the growth of big data from numerous sensing devices and cutting-edge computing resources. The growth of big data from various sensors and advanced computing technologies is driving AI development. We must first examine AI's development and history in order to comprehend its functions in AV systems. To understand AI's role in AV systems, it's important to review its historical development and advancements.
