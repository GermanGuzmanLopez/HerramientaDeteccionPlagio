Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to reshape future transportation systems, and decision making is one of the critical modules toward high-level automated driving. AVs are anticipated to transform future transportation infrastructures, with decision making being a pivotal element for advanced automated driving. To overcome those complicated scenarios that rule-based methods could not cope with well, data-driven decision-making approaches have aroused more focus. To address complex situations where rule-based methods fall short, data-driven decision-making techniques have gained increased attention. The datasets to be used in developing data-driven methods dramatically influence the performance of decision making; hence, it is necessary to have a comprehensive insight into the existing datasets. The performance of data-driven methods in decision making is heavily dependent on the quality of the datasets used, making it crucial to thoroughly understand the available datasets. From the aspects of collection sources, driving data can be divided into vehicle-, environment-, and driver-related data. Driving data can be categorized into vehicle-related, environment-related, and driver-related data based on their sources of collection. This study compares the state-of-the-art datasets of these three categories and summarizes their features, including sensors used, annotation, and driving scenarios. This research compares leading datasets across these three categories, highlighting their features such as the sensors utilized, data annotation methods, and driving scenarios. Based on the characteristics of the datasets, this survey also discusses potential applications of datasets on various aspects of AV decision making, assisting researchers in finding appropriate ones to support their own research. The survey also examines potential uses of these datasets in different areas of AV decision making, aiding researchers in selecting suitable datasets for their studies. The future trends of AV dataset development are summarized. Lastly, the future directions for AV dataset development are outlined.
