There are a large number of functional sensors installed on the modern intelligent vehicles. Modern intelligent vehicles are equipped with numerous functional sensors. Many Artificial Intelligence based foundation models have been proposed for smart sensing to recognize the known object classes in the new but similar scenarios. Various AI-based foundational models have been developed for smart sensing, capable of recognizing known object classes in novel yet comparable scenarios. However, it is still challenging for the foundation models of smart sensing to detect all the object classes in both seen and unseen scenarios. Despite advancements, these models struggle to detect all object classes across both familiar and unfamiliar scenarios. This letter aims at pushing the boundary of smart sensing research for intelligent vehicles. This letter seeks to advance the research frontiers of smart sensing for intelligent vehicles. We first summarize the current widely-used foundation models and the foundation intelligence needed for smart sensing of intelligent vehicles. We begin by summarizing the prevalent foundational models and the necessary foundational intelligence for smart sensing in intelligent vehicles. We then explain Sora-based Parallel Vision to boost the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and final generalized intelligence (3.0). Next, we introduce Sora-based Parallel Vision to elevate smart sensing models from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and ultimately to generalized intelligence (3.0). Several representative case studies are discussed to show the potential usages of Sora-based Parallel Vision, followed by its future research direction. We discuss several case studies to illustrate the potential applications of Sora-based Parallel Vision, and conclude with future research directions.
