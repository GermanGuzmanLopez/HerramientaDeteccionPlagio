In hospitality companies, failures in artificial intelligence (AI) services are unavoidable; therefore, addressing how AI service recovery can retain customers is crucial. This study shifts from the traditional “intelligence quotient” approach and investigates the impact of empathetic responses on service recovery through the lens of emotional intelligence. Through four experimental scenarios, it was found that high-empathy AI responses during service recovery can enhance customers’ intention to continue using the service. Psychological distance and trust serve as sequential mediators in this process. Additionally, compared to interactions involving only a single sensory stimulus (text), high-empathy responses incorporating multisensory stimuli (text and voice) were found to enhance the effectiveness of empathy responses in recovery. This research broadens the scope of AI service studies by focusing on the continued use of AI following service failures. It moves beyond the traditional focus on improving intelligence quotient and highlights the significance of leveraging AI emotional intelligence to elicit customer emotional responses during service recovery. Ultimately, it offers a valuable tool for autonomously addressing AI service failures within the service process, which holds significant importance for research and development, as well as for hospitality operators, in the promotion and implementation of AI services.
