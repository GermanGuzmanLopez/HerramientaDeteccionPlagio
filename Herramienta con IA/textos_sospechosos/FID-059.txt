In the 21st century, the global waste problem has become more severe in developing countries that rely on manual sorting. Improper waste management poses serious risks to both human health and the environment, making the implementation of Artificial Intelligence-Based Solid Waste Segregation Technology (AIBSWST) essential. In this context, the advanced Frank t-norm is important for capturing nuanced relationships in fuzzy logic, particularly in situations where the order of fuzzy sets is significant. Based on these principles, the complex q-rung picture fuzzy set (Cq-RPFS) is valuable for representing decision-makers' preferences in a two-dimensional manner, improving the management of ambiguous information in practical scenarios. Expanding on these foundational concepts, this paper introduces innovative Frank operations using Frank t-norms within the framework of Cq-RPFS. By utilizing these operations, the paper proposes four robust aggregation operators (AOs) under Cq-RPFS: complex q-rung picture fuzzy Frank weighted average (Cq-PFFWA), complex q-rung picture fuzzy Frank weighted geometric (Cq-PFFWG), complex q-rung picture fuzzy Frank ordered weighted average (Cq-PFFWOA), and complex q-rung picture fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric (Cq-PFFWOG). These AOs possess key properties such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. To validate these strategies, a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method based on the proposed AOs is suggested. A real-life case study on Indiaâ€™s implementation of AIBSWST is presented as a practical application, with comprehensive analyses, including sensitivity, comparative, and superiority assessments, to evaluate the performance of the approaches. A detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed AOs is included in the analysis, highlighting the importance of the approach in promoting cleanliness and health in developing countries.
