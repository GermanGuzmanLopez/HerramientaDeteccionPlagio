The most recent efforts to provide computing resources as a service to managers and consumers signify a transition from viewing computing as a product to be purchased, to considering it as a service delivered to users via the internet from large-scale data centers. With the rise of cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are enhancing customer experience automations across various applications such as recommender systems (RS), there is a growing need for adjustments to support IoT devices central to the automation landscape. This includes advancements such as language models like ChatGPT and Bard, and emerging technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a new computing advancement: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Despite numerous studies on FC "smart" applications, no research has yet focused on fog-based smart marketing domains like recommender systems. FC is a novel computational system that can reduce latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time, data-driven decision making. This paper offers a conceptual framework to study the impact of fog computing on consumer behavior, aiming to inspire future research by examining the intersection of FC and RS. Our conceptualization of "fog-based recommender systems" presents many new and challenging opportunities for academic research, some of which are discussed in the latter part of this paper.
