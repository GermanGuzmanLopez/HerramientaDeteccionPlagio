This paper introduces a model for adjustable moisture control in historical buildings. The proposed system is designed as a flexible IoT infrastructure, utilizing a complex network of sensors to monitor indoor humidity conditions and compare these readings to external factors such as groundwater levels, rainfall, and wind speed, thereby managing the drying system. The control model employs type-2 fuzzy logic reasoning, allowing for flexible adjustments based on the intensity of water absorption. Consequently, the proposed model represents an innovative intelligent system for controlling interior conditions in historical buildings. The developed system was installed and tested in an old brewery building. Research findings demonstrate its efficiency in dehumidification while maintaining the lowest possible cost.
