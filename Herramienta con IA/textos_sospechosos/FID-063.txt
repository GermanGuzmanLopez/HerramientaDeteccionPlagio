By 2021, over 30 countries had issued national strategies for artificial intelligence (AI) policy. These policy documents outline plans and expectations for AI's impact across various sectors, including education, and often address the social and ethical implications of AI. This study performs a thematic analysis of 24 such national AI policy strategies to examine the role of education in global AI policy discussions. It reveals that AI in education (AIED) is mostly missing from policy debates, despite a strong emphasis on education's role in building an AI-ready workforce and training AI experts. Furthermore, the ethical implications of AIED are minimally addressed, even though AI ethics are frequently discussed in these policy documents. This indicates that AIED, along with its broader policy and ethical considerations, has not been widely recognized by key decision-makers, which is problematic given the essential connection between effective policy and ethical considerations, as argued in this study. Given these findings, the study uses a framework of five AI ethics principles to explore how policymakers can better integrate AIEDâ€™s implications. Lastly, the study provides recommendations for AIED scholars on how to engage with the policymaking process and conduct ethics and policy-oriented AIED research to influence policy discussions for the public benefit.
