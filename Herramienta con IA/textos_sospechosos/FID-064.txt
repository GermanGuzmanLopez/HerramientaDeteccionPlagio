Engineering education is continually advancing to align with the latest technological innovations and address the evolving demands of the engineering sector. A notable advancement in this area is the implementation of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT can potentially deliver personalized and efficient learning experiences by offering students tailored feedback and explanations, along with developing realistic virtual simulations for practical learning. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this technology. Generative AI systems like ChatGPT are constrained by their training data and may perpetuate biases or produce and disseminate misinformation. Furthermore, incorporating generative AI in education introduces ethical concerns, such as the risk of unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential displacement of human workers due to technological redundancy. Although the current capabilities of generative AI technology exemplified by ChatGPT are impressive yet imperfect, they hint at future possibilities. Engineering educators must grasp the implications of this technology and explore ways to adapt the engineering education framework to ensure that future engineers can leverage the advantages of generative AI while mitigating any adverse effects.
