Technological advancements have significantly enhanced surgery, particularly minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which includes laparoscopic and robotic procedures. This progress has increased the number of technologies available in the operating room, providing additional information about surgical procedures, such as instrument usage and trajectories. Among these technologies, the amount of data extracted from surgical videos captured by endoscopes is notably substantial. Consequently, automating data analysis in surgery is crucial to reduce data complexity while maximizing its utility, thereby creating new opportunities for research and development. Computer vision (CV) focuses on enabling computers to interpret digital images or videos and aims to automate tasks typically performed by the human visual system. Given that this field encompasses all processes related to real-world information acquisition by computers, the term “CV” covers a wide range, from image sensing hardware to AI-based image recognition. AI-based image recognition for simple tasks, such as identifying snapshots, has advanced to a level comparable to human performance in recent years. While recognizing surgical videos presents more complexity and challenges, successfully applying this technology to MIS could lead to future advancements, such as support for intraoperative decision-making and image-guided surgery. Ultimately, it might pave the way for fully automated surgery. This article reviews the recent advancements and future outlook of AI-related research and development in the field of surgery.
