This study addresses the challenge of asymmetric face recognition, where the number of names in a list and the number of faces in a photo do not necessarily match, yet each face must be automatically labeled with a name. The motivation for this problem arises from the many meetings held in the past, where participants took group photos, and the meeting only provided a corresponding list of participant names without one-to-one labels. In the worst-case scenario, group photos might include faces of individuals who did not attend the meeting. Additionally, some meeting attendees might not appear in photos as they were taking pictures. This study proposes an asymmetric face recognition mechanism, abbreviated as AFRM. Initially, AFRM uses the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect and extract all faces from photos. Then, AFRM extracts features from each face using the convolution feature map (Conv_FF) and employs these features to categorize the faces into different classes. Next, AFRM utilizes a statistics-based mechanism to map each name on the list to each face class. According to this mapping, each face will be associated with one name. To quickly identify a face during a meeting, AFRM applies the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to represent the features of each face. During a new meeting, AFRM can extract the feature of one face and use KNN to derive the features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves more than 97% accuracy without requiring one-to-one name and face labeling.
