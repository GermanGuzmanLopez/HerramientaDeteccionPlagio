The potential for connected automated vehicles is extensive, with advancements largely focusing on the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) to support artificial intelligence (AI). Early innovations in engineering, electronics, and other fields have significantly influenced AI. Various technological proposals exist for use in automated vehicles. These vehicles play a crucial role in optimizing traffic and reducing casualties. Vehicle autonomy development can be categorized into two areas: high-level system integrations such as new-energy vehicles and intelligent transportation systems, and advancements in subsystems like sensors and information processing. The Advanced Driver Assistance System has demonstrated the ability to address real-world issues in vehicle autonomy. Situational intelligence, which gathers vast amounts of data, is vital for creating high-definition city maps, land surveying, and road quality assessments. The transport infotainment system encompasses the driverâ€™s gesture recognition, language interaction, and environmental perception, assisted by cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), as well as object localization in the scene. This chapter explores the history of autonomous vehicles (AV), current research trends in AI technology for AVs, state-of-the-art datasets utilized in AV research, and various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that form the basis of AV systems. It concludes with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities associated with AI in AVs.
