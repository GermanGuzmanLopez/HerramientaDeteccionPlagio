Remote healthcare applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) deliver rapid and preventative medical services to at-risk patients. However, accurately predicting heart disease remains a challenging task, with diagnosis results often lacking precision. To tackle this challenge, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using an IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been developed, aimed at offering early diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac conditions. Initially, physiological data are remotely collected from patients using four biosensors: ECG sensor, pressure sensor, pulse sensor, and glucose sensor. An Arduino controller processes the data received from these IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. A cardiovascular disease prediction model is implemented using a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) attention model, which diagnoses cardiovascular disease and categorizes it into five distinct cardiovascular classes. The recommendation system then provides physical and dietary advice to cardiac patients based on the classified data, delivered via a mobile application. The performance of DEEP-CARDIO is validated using Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) with real-time Framingham and Statlog heart disease datasets. The proposed DEEP-CARDIO method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.90%, outperforming other methods such as MABC-SVM, HCBDA, and MLbPM, which achieve accuracies of 86.91%, 88.65%, and 93.63%, respectively.
