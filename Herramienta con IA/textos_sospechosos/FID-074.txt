In recent years, artificial intelligence has become a vital aspect of daily life, making it an essential component for both production and service systems. Known as driverless cars, automated driving vehicles operate autonomously without the need for a human driver. Research on autonomous vehicles has seen significant advancements recently. The current need of society is artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles. Although some people may be apprehensive about allowing a computer to control their vehicle, automated driving technologies have the potential to enhance road safety. Self-driving cars can address both environmental and safety-related issues. Unlike humans, computers do not struggle to maintain attention while driving. Furthermore, by responding appropriately, an automated car can prevent accidents in potentially dangerous situations on the road. One of the many advantages of self-driving technology is that it provides more accessible means of transport to individuals who are unable to drive. Many people are unable to operate a vehicle due to various reasons such as inexperience, incapacity, or age. These individuals can travel much more safely and independently. Therefore, this chapter will explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars, as well as their components, benefits, and future developments.
