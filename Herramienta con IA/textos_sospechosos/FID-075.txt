One of the modern approaches to cognitive enhancement and improving the abilities and competencies of managers, including strategic thinking skills, is the use of gamification and video games. Video games are widely used by many organizations in the fields of education, marketing, business, and entrepreneurship. This research aimed to investigate the impact of video games on enhancing managers' strategic thinking and their potential contribution to developing cognitive capabilities. The sample consisted of 30 students who were actively involved in the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. To measure the participants' strategic thinking, Pisapiaâ€™s strategic thinking questionnaire was utilized, and the CANTAB test was used to assess their cognitive capabilities. Indicators such as micro-management, planning, plan recognition, predictions, gathering resources, partial observability, and damage avoidance were designed to identify the individuals' game-playing styles. The findings showed that 53.3 percent of the participants exhibited reflective thinking, 30 percent demonstrated systems thinking, and the remaining participants had a reframing thinking style as their dominant strategic thinking dimension. Furthermore, the correlation between the damage avoidance criteria with thinking and reflective style, and the inverse and significant correlation of the gathering resources criteria with the PRM test results, suggest that strategic games have the potential to alter and develop cognitive functions like attention, reaction, and memory. These games can thus be considered effective tools for enhancing cognitive abilities and subsequently promoting strategic thinking and decision-making skills in managers.
