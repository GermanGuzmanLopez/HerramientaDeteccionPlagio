A public lighting system that uses artificial intelligence technology to optimize energy management and improve lighting quality in public areas is referred to as an intelligent lighting system. This paper discusses the application of two prominent artificial intelligence methods, fuzzy logic and neural networks, for intelligent power control in public lighting networks. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of these approaches in optimizing power consumption and achieving efficient lighting, considering two parameters: road flow and weather conditions. To accomplish this, the lighting system was modeled using the state flow tool in MATLAB/Simulink. Various algorithms based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were subsequently developed. Real data on traffic flow and cloud cover were used to train these algorithms. Upon analyzing the simulation results, it was observed that algorithms based on neural networks produced results closer to those of the algorithm based on fuzzy logic.
