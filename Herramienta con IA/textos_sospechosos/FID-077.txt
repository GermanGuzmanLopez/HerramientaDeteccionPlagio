The potential for connected automated vehicles is multifaceted, and automated advancements heavily involve the development of the Internet of Things (IoTs) to enable artificial intelligence (AI). Early innovations in engineering, electronics, and many other fields have provided inspiration for AI. There are various proposed technologies for use in automated vehicles. These vehicles play a significant role in optimizing traffic and reducing casualties. When studying vehicle autonomy, development can be categorized into two types: high-level system integrations, such as new-energy vehicles and intelligent transportation systems, and backward subsystem advancements, such as sensor and information processing systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System has demonstrated the ability to address real-world issues in vehicle autonomy. Situational intelligence, which gathers vast amounts of data, is used for high-definition city map creation, land surveying, and road quality checks. The transport infotainment system encompasses driver's gesture recognition, language interaction, and environmental perception, assisted by cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), as well as object localization in the scene. This chapter explores the history of autonomous vehicles (AV), current research trends in AI technology for AVs, state-of-the-art datasets used in AV research, and various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that form the basis of AV systems, concluding with the challenges and opportunities associated with AI in AVs.
