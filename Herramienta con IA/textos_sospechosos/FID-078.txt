Internet of Things (IoT) based remote healthcare applications deliver rapid and preventative medical services to patients at risk. Predicting heart disease, however, is a complex task, and diagnostic results are often inaccurate. To tackle this problem, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been developed to provide early diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac diseases. Initially, physiological data are collected remotely from patients using four biosensors: ECG sensor, pressure sensor, pulse sensor, and glucose sensor. An Arduino controller receives this data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. The cardiovascular disease prediction model is implemented using a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) attention model, which diagnoses cardiovascular disease and classifies it into five distinct cardiovascular classes. The recommendation system then provides physical and dietary advice to cardiac patients based on the classified data via a mobile application. The performance of DEEP-CARDIO is validated using Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) with real-time Framingham and Statlog heart disease datasets. The proposed DEEP-CARDIO method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.90%, whereas the MABC-SVM, HCBDA, and MLbPM methods achieve 86.91%, 88.65%, and 93.63%, respectively.
