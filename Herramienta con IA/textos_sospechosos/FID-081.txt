In recent years, the continuous advancement of science and technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, machine algorithms, and other related fields, has prompted the education system to shift from traditional functions to more personalized content. Traditional education systems typically use a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching, which fails to consider the unique needs and learning styles of each student. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, a personalized and optimized education system can offer customized learning materials and recommendations based on each student's learning history, interests, and abilities, thereby improving learning outcomes. Moreover, machine learning algorithms can provide real-time feedback on student performance and adapt learning plans accordingly, making the learning process more dynamic and personalized. This approach can be applied to various types of education, including language learning, mathematics, and science. However, the efficiency of machine learning algorithms is heavily dependent on the enhancement of numerical optimization algorithms, necessitating a comprehensive summary of optimization algorithms in large-scale machine learning. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of existing machine learning algorithms for optimizing personalized education recommendation systems and introduces the algorithm optimization process.
