Emotion recognition is the ability to accurately infer human emotions from various sources and modalities using questionnaires, physical signals, and physiological signals. Recently, emotion recognition has gained attention due to its diverse application areas, such as affective computing, healthcare, human-robot interactions, and market research. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of emotion recognition techniques from the current decade. The paper includes emotion recognition using both physical and physiological signals. Physical signals encompass speech and facial expressions, while physiological signals include electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms, galvanic skin responses, and eye tracking. The paper introduces various emotion models, stimuli used for emotion elicitation, and the background of existing automated emotion recognition systems. This review involves comprehensive searching and scanning of well-known datasets, followed by the design criteria for review. After a thorough analysis and discussion, 142 journal articles were selected using PRISMA guidelines. The review offers a detailed analysis of existing studies and available datasets on emotion recognition. Our analysis also highlights potential challenges in the existing literature and suggests directions for future research.
