The latest initiative in delivering computing resources as a service to managers and consumers signifies a transition from computing as a product that is purchased to computing as a service delivered over the internet from large-scale data centers. However, with the emergence of cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are enhancing customer experience automations across various application areas like recommender systems (RS), there is a need for several modifications to support IoT devices central to the automation landscape, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard, as well as technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a new computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). While numerous research studies have been conducted on FC “smart” applications, none have yet addressed fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered an innovative computational system capable of mitigating latency and improving bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications that require real-time data-driven decision making. This paper offers a conceptual framework for examining the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, aiming to stimulate future research by exploring the intersection of FC and RS as an example. Indeed, our conceptualization of “fog-based recommender systems” presents many new and challenging opportunities for academic research, some of which are discussed later in this paper.
