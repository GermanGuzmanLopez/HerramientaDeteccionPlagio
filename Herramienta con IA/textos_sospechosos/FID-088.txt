In this study, we investigated the dynamic field of fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence (AI) in financial analysis from 1990 to 2023. Utilizing the bibliometrix package in RStudio and data from the Web of Science, our focus was on identifying mathematical models and the evolving role of fuzzy information granulation in this domain. The research addresses the urgent need to comprehend the development and impact of fuzzy logic and AI within the broader scope of advancing technological and analytical methodologies, particularly in financial and banking contexts. The bibliometric analysis involved an extensive review of the literature published during this period. Key metrics such as annual growth rate, international collaboration, and average citations per document were examined, highlighting the field’s expansion and collaborative nature. The results revealed a significant annual growth rate of 19.54%, international collaboration at 21.16%, and an average of 25.52 citations per document. Major journals like IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, the Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, and Information Sciences emerged as significant contributors, aligning with Bradford’s Law’s Zone 1. Post-2020, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems saw a substantial increase in publications. A notable finding was the high citation rate of seminal research on fuzzy information granulation, underscoring its mathematical importance and practical relevance in financial analysis. Keywords like “design,” “model,” “algorithm,” “optimization,” and “stabilization,” along with terms such as “fuzzy logic controller,” “adaptive fuzzy controller,” and “fuzzy logic approach,” were prevalent. The Countries’ Collaboration World Map indicated a strong pattern of global interconnections, suggesting a robust framework of international collaboration. Our study highlights the growing influence of fuzzy logic and AI in financial analysis, marked by increased research outputs and global collaborations. It underscores the essential role of fuzzy information granulation as a mathematical model and sets the stage for further exploration into how fuzzy logic and AI-driven models are transforming financial and banking analysis practices worldwide.
