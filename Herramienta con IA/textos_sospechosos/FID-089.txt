Our research explores how people distribute risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic, extending the ethical debate beyond unavoidable collision scenarios. We conducted a representative survey in Germany, using an interactive graphical representation of different traffic situations to measure participants' preferences on driving maneuvers of AVs. Our findings suggest that participants' preferences deviate significantly from mere collision avoidance, indicating a willingness to take risks themselves for the benefit of other road users. This highlights the ethically relevant questions arising from the permanent redistribution of risk among road users in everyday driving scenarios. Our research aims to bridge the gap between engineers and philosophers, facilitating a more constructive discussion on the ethics of AVs.
