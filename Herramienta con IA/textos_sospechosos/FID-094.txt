Artificial intelligence chatbots have become prevalent in the tourism industry due to their cost-effectiveness and efficiency. However, little attention has been given to the impact of emotional expressions exhibited by chatbots on service outcomes. Leveraging the expectancy violations theory, we investigated how these emotional expressions influence customer satisfaction in the context of tourist attraction recommendations through three experiments.

Our findings suggest that chatbots expressing concern for customers can enhance satisfaction levels by mitigating expectancy violations. Furthermore, several factors were identified as moderators in this relationship. For instance, the customer's goal orientation, the human-like characteristics of chatbot avatars, and the type of relationship between customers and chatbots can all influence the extent to which emotional expression affects expectancy violation.

These results contribute to the understanding of emotional expressions in chatbots and offer valuable insights for their deployment in customer service within the tourism industry. By recognizing the significance of emotional cues in interactions with chatbots, businesses can better tailor their services to meet customer expectations and enhance overall satisfaction levels.
