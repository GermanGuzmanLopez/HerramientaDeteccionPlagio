In this study, the effectiveness of facial feminization surgery (FFS) for male-to-female transgender patients was objectively evaluated using artificial intelligence facial recognition software. Preoperative and postoperative images of 27 transgender women undergoing FFS were analyzed to assess changes in perceived gender and age, as well as their correlation with patient-reported facial satisfaction.

Amazon's AI facial recognition software was utilized to determine gender, femininity confidence score, and perceived age based on standardized frontal images. Results showed that preoperatively, FFS images were perceived as female only 48.1% of the time, which significantly improved to 74.1% postoperatively. Additionally, femininity confidence scores increased significantly from preoperative mean scores of 0.04 to 0.39 postoperatively.

The study also found that FFS led to a decrease in perceived age relative to the patient's true age, with older patients experiencing greater reductions. However, there was no significant correlation between improved female gender typing and patient facial satisfaction, suggesting that other factors may influence satisfaction with facial appearance.

Interestingly, undergoing surgery at a younger age was associated with higher overall facial satisfaction, indicating the importance of timing in FFS procedures. Overall, transfeminine patients experienced improvements in satisfaction with facial appearance, perceived gender, and decreases in perceived age following FFS, highlighting the positive impact of FFS on patient well-being and self-image.
