The chapter delves into the transformative potential of digital technology in fostering peacebuilding through education, while also acknowledging the inherent benefits and risks associated with its utilization. The authors advocate for an approach rooted in human-centered design (HCD), which places the needs and perspectives of learners at the forefront.

Through the presentation of three case studies, the chapter illustrates how digital storytelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and gaming can serve as powerful tools in advancing peacebuilding efforts. The first case study delves into the use of digital storytelling as a means to educate about genocide, while the second explores the application of AI in safeguarding victims of violence. The third case study examines the role of gaming in raising awareness of war-related issues.

Recognizing the complexity inherent in each of these technologies, the authors propose exercises in imagination aimed at exploring the potential of liberatory design. By embracing a forward-thinking and inclusive approach, practitioners can harness the transformative power of digital technologies to promote peace and reconciliation.

The chapter concludes by underscoring the importance of acknowledging the dual nature of technology, which can both exacerbate conflict and facilitate peacebuilding efforts. By adopting a nuanced understanding of technology's ambivalent nature, stakeholders can leverage its potential to create positive social change and foster lasting peace.
