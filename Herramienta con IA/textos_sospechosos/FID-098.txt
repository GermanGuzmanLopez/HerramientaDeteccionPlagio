Easy internet access and technological advancements have led to information overload and an abundance of choices, complicating decision-making for users. Recommender Systems (RS) offer a potential solution by assisting users in making decisions through recommendations or predictions of product ratings. Three fundamental forms of RS, utilizing implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation, include collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering approaches. While ratings are the most common form of feedback, product descriptions, reviews, images, audios, and videos are also valuable and can enhance the performance of traditional RS.

These additional variables can significantly impact the performance of RS. Initially, traditional RSs relied on approaches such as nearest neighbor or other machine learning models. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning have enabled the development of RSs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which efficiently exploit auxiliary information.

This article not only compares CNN-based RSs on common grounds but also provides a comprehensive examination of CNN-based RSs and how they can leverage various types of auxiliary information. The study delves into data characteristics, statistics, and auxiliary information across a range of publicly available datasets. Moreover, different evaluation measures for RSs are discussed, offering readers insights into intriguing challenges and open research issues within the field.
