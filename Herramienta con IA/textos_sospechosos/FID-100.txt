The advancement and complexity of modern automobiles have necessitated fault detection methods beyond manual or trial-and-error approaches. Fault detection technologies in the automotive industry aim to identify potential or existing faults, which typically encompass mechanical or electrical issues such as those affecting the airbag control unit, radiator, gearbox, transmission control unit, tyre pressure, brakes, air conditioner, cylinder casket, alternator, and hubs.

Each fault manifests specific or related signs and symptoms, prompting the development of various fault detection methods, including binary logic, fuzzy logic, and artificial intelligence techniques with diverse algorithms. In this research, a fuzzy logic-based approach utilizing Mamdani Algorithm was employed, offering a superior fault detection mechanism. Proposed by Ebrahim Mamdani, Mamdaniâ€™s algorithm serves as a fuzzy inference method characterized by intuitive and analytically tractable rule-bases.

The Mamdani algorithm generates fuzzy sets derived from the output membership function of the fuzzy inference system for decision-making. Implemented as a web-based technology, this research utilized JavaScript, JQuery, SQL Server, ASP.Net, Bootstrap 3.5, and CSS. The system output demonstrated substantial improvement over existing fault detection methods in automobiles, showcasing the efficacy of the fuzzy logic-based approach.

Overall, this research underscores the significance of advanced fault detection methodologies in the automotive industry and highlights the potential of fuzzy logic-based techniques, particularly Mamdani Algorithm, in enhancing fault detection accuracy and efficiency.
