Charitable organizations globally are grappling with a labor shortage, prompting the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to alleviate the strain. However, the efficacy and limitations of AI fundraisers remain unclear, necessitating further investigation. To deepen our understanding of AI fundraisers, this study engaged 654 adults via an online crowdsourcing platform and developed six chatbot agents with varying characteristics (emotional vs. factual Ã— no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image).

Initially, an independent samples t-test was conducted to assess the impact of chatbots' conversational styles on participants' willingness to donate to victims of the Ukraine war. Subsequently, the study explored the mediating roles of perceived humanness and empathy towards victims in the relationship between chatbots' emotional expression and willingness to donate through serial multiple mediation analysis.

Moreover, the study examined the moderating role of visual cues (no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image) by conducting moderated serial multiple mediation analysis. The findings indicated that emotional chatbots elicited greater willingness to donate, with perceived humanness and empathy serving as independent and serial mediators. However, visual cues did not significantly moderate the relationship between chatbots' emotional expression and willingness to donate.

These results shed light on the nuanced dynamics of AI fundraisers and underscore the importance of emotional expression in fostering donor engagement. Furthermore, they highlight the pivotal roles of perceived humanness and empathy in mediating the impact of emotional chatbots on donation behavior.
