In Nigeria, the prevalence of various security concerns has led to an increase in crime rates, despite the existence of stringent laws and penalties aimed at deterrence. This has created a perception that authorities are struggling to effectively combat crime. To address this challenge and enhance criminal identification and investigation efforts, the implementation of a facial recognition system linked to a continuously updated digital database is essential.

The primary focus of this paper is the development of an automatic criminal investigation system capable of identifying criminals based on facial features and generating real-time digital profiles. The system relies on the Haar Cascades Classifier technique within the OpenCV package for object detection and facial recognition.

In terms of programming languages, Python 3.6 was selected along with the Django 4.2 framework, OpenCV-Python, and Dlib for efficient execution. Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities and support for various databases, including SQLite3, facilitated the creation of a lightweight database suitable for the application's needs.

The design and implementation of the DICA-FR (Digital Criminal Investigation and Facial Recognition) system adhered to the principles outlined in the 12-factor app idea, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and robustness. During image processing, the Haar method was employed for face detection, followed by post-processing to compare detected faces with known criminal face encodings for matching purposes.

The results of the study indicate that the DICA-FR system effectively supplements human efforts in criminal investigations by enabling facial recognition from long distances, displaying offender names, and providing alerts through the DICA web application interface. This system represents a functional prototype with the potential for deployment in the criminal investigative process within Nigeria.
