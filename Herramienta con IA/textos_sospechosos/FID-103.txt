With the advancing complexity of modern automobiles, fault detection has transcended manual or trial-and-error methods. Fault detection technologies in the automotive industry are employed to pinpoint potential or existing faults in vehicles, encompassing mechanical and electrical issues such as airbag control unit malfunctions, radiator problems, gearbox issues, tyre pressure abnormalities, brake faults, air conditioner malfunctions, cylinder gasket defects, alternator troubles, and hub malfunctions, among others. Each fault manifests specific or related signs and symptoms.

Various fault detection methods exist, including binary logic, fuzzy logic, and artificial intelligence techniques utilizing different algorithms. In this research, we utilized a fuzzy logic-based approach employing Mamdani Algorithm, which offers a superior fault detection mechanism. Proposed by Ebrahim Mamdani, Mamdani's algorithm serves as a fuzzy inference method characterized by intuitive and analytically tractable rule-bases. It generates fuzzy sets derived from the output membership function of the fuzzy inference system for decision-making.

Implemented as a web-based technology, this research leveraged JavaScript, JQuery, SQL Server, ASP.Net, Bootstrap 3.5, and CSS. The system's output demonstrated significant improvement compared to other existing fault detection methods in automobiles.
