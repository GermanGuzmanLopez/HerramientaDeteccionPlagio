The evolution of technology has revolutionized surgical practices, particularly in the realm of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), encompassing techniques like laparoscopic and robotic surgery. This technological surge has introduced a plethora of innovations into the operating room, furnishing invaluable insights into surgical procedures, such as instrument usage and trajectories, through various technologies. Notably, the wealth of information extracted from surgical videos captured by endoscopes underscores the pivotal role of automated data analysis in surgery. Such automation serves to streamline data complexity while enhancing its utility, thereby unlocking novel avenues for research and development.

At the forefront of this endeavor is computer vision (CV), a discipline focused on enabling computers to comprehend digital images or videos and automate tasks akin to the human visual system. Given its broad scope, ranging from image sensing hardware to AI-driven image recognition, CV holds immense potential in surgery. Recent advancements in AI-based image recognition have propelled its capabilities to rival human performance, particularly in tasks like snapshot recognition. While recognizing surgical videos poses a more complex challenge, effective application in MIS holds promise for future surgical breakthroughs, including intraoperative decision-making support and image-guided surgery. Ultimately, the realization of automated surgery looms on the horizon.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and future prospects in AI-related research and development within the surgical domain, shedding light on the transformative potential of technology in enhancing surgical outcomes.
