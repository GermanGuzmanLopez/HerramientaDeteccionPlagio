Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents the concept that, eventually, artificial intelligence (AI) advancements may lead to the emergence of an unprecedented agent surpassing even the most brilliant human intellects. This notion has persisted since the nascent stages of AI development, sparking numerous speculative and scholarly works exploring potential scenarios regarding the behavior of such AI towards humanity. This paper critically evaluates the current landscape of AI advancements and the escalating pace of the AI race, characterized by the rapid emergence of groundbreaking AI methodologies capable of surpassing human capabilities, deceiving humans, and disrupting job markets in ways previously deemed unattainable by AI. These developments have fueled apprehensions that AGI may be approaching sooner than anticipated. However, the analysis primarily centers on three specific categories of modern AI systems, aiming to demonstrate that deep neural networks, prevalent across most contemporary AI methodologies, exhibit substantial limitations that render them unsuitable candidates for realizing AGI. Consequently, the paper contends that while concerns about the swift evolution of AI are warranted, the primary risks lie not in the imminent emergence of AGI but rather in the current models' limitations, applications, and the absence of regulatory frameworks.
