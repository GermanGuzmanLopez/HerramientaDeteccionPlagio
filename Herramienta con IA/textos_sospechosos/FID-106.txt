A defining characteristic of contemporary society is our enduring faith in technology across various domains, including education. This strong inclination towards technology, often termed as 'techno-philia,' has significantly influenced the dynamics of the classroom, altering the interactions between teachers and students, as well as among students themselves. These interactions have shifted towards a more transactional ('I–It') approach rather than a relational ('I–Thou') one, leading to decreased levels of bonding and connectedness. This trend is further compounded by the concept of 'learnification,' which perceives teachers primarily as facilitators of learning rather than experts imparting knowledge. In this article, I analyze the current trend of technological integration in education and its impact on classroom dynamics, discuss Martin Buber's theories of 'I–It' and 'I–Thou' relationships and their relevance to education, and explore, through a hypothetical scenario, the potential of artificial intelligence to eventually replace human teachers in the classroom.
