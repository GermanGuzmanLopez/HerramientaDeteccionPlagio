Grain production holds significant sway over the global economy, prompting a growing demand for efficient and secure methods of food cultivation. Information Technology emerges as a pivotal tool in addressing this need. Among the array of available solutions, computer vision coupled with artificial intelligence algorithms stands out for its remarkable efficacy in detecting patterns within images. This study undertakes a systematic review to delineate the applicability of computer vision in precision agriculture, focusing on the cultivation of the world's top five grains: maize, rice, wheat, soybean, and barley. Through the review, 25 papers published in the past five years are analyzed, showcasing diverse approaches in addressing aspects such as disease detection, grain quality assessment, and phenotyping. The findings of the review unveil promising opportunities, including the utilization of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and advanced artificial intelligence techniques like Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), in crafting robust computer vision methodologies tailored for precision agriculture.
