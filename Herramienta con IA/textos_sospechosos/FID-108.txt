The intelligence of Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) systems increasingly relies on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition due to the diverse applications of emotion classification, such as recommender systems and cognitive load detection. Emotion classification has recently garnered significant attention in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. This article presents a systematic review of automated emotion recognition from EEG signals utilizing AI. The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study encompasses EEG databases and preprocessing methods, as well as feature extraction and selection techniques. Moreover, it categorizes the included studies into two types: i) deep learning (DL)-based emotion identification systems and ii) machine learning (ML)-based emotion classification models. The analyzed systems are evaluated based on their features, classification approaches, classifiers, types of emotions classified, accuracy rates, and the datasets utilized. Additionally, the review provides an insightful comparison, explores feature research trends, and proposes new avenues for investigation.
