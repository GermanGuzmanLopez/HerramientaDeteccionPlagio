Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a pivotal tool within contemporary technology, empowering users to engage with machines through diverse modalities. Those with visual impairments encounter difficulties in performing tasks due to either blindness or impaired vision, collectively termed as BVI (Blind and Visually Impaired). It is imperative that solutions evolve alongside technological advancements to facilitate effective navigation of their surroundings and provide real-time assistance. This research endeavors to support visually challenged individuals within the community by conducting surveys and deploying smart devices capable of recognizing faces, colors, and objects. Furthermore, the study underscores the utilization of various technologies and methodologies previously employed to aid visually impaired individuals in their daily routines.
