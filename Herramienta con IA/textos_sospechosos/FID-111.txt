Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize legal document analysis by automating tedious tasks and providing accurate insights. However, the impact of AI transparency on legal professionals' trust and decision-making remains underexplored. Using case studies, we analyzed how transparent AI models affect the acceptance and effectiveness of legal document analysis. Transparent AI models significantly increased trust and decision-making efficiency among legal professionals. The study also identified key legal terms and patterns that AI can effectively analyze. These findings support the development of transparent AI tools to enhance their application in the legal field.
