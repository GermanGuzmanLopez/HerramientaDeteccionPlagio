Human-robot interaction (HRI) is significantly enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI), enabling robots to perform complex tasks collaboratively with humans. However, the effect of robot transparency on human trust and collaboration efficiency has not been extensively studied. Through interactive experiments, we evaluated how transparent AI explanations in robots influence human-robot collaboration. Robots that provided clear explanations for their actions improved human trust and task efficiency. The study also examined the role of AI in predicting human intentions to enhance collaboration. These insights highlight the importance of transparency in AI-driven human-robot interaction.
