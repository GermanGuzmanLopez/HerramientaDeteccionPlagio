The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in personalized medicine offers tailored treatment plans based on individual patient data. Yet, the acceptance of AI recommendations by healthcare providers is not well understood. Through a series of clinical studies, we assessed how the interpretability of AI recommendations affects their adoption in personalized medicine. Clear and understandable AI recommendations increased the likelihood of adoption by healthcare providers. The research also highlighted the potential of AI to identify novel treatment pathways. These findings emphasize the need for transparent AI in advancing personalized medicine.
