Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in climate change prediction due to its processing power and predictive accuracy. However, the interpretability of AI models in this context remains a challenge. We investigated the impact of transparent AI models on the trust of climate scientists and policymakers. Transparent models improved understanding and trust, facilitating better policy decisions. The study also identified critical variables influencing climate predictions, contributing to more effective climate action strategies. These insights advocate for the development of interpretable AI to enhance its application in climate change prediction.
