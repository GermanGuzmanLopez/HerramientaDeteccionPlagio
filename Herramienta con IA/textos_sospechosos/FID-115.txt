Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming customer service in retail by offering personalized interactions. Nonetheless, the role of AI's adaptability to customer emotions on service quality needs further investigation. Through field experiments in retail settings, we analyzed how emotionally adaptive AI agents affect customer satisfaction and loyalty. AI agents that adjusted their responses based on customer emotions resulted in higher satisfaction and increased repeat business. The study also highlighted the importance of real-time emotion recognition in enhancing service interactions. These findings support the integration of emotionally adaptive AI in retail customer service.
