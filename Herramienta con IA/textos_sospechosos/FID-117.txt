The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial forecasting has transformed predictive analytics. Despite its success, the interpretability of AI models in finance is under-examined. We explored how model transparency affects the trust of financial analysts using AI-driven forecasts. Transparent AI models significantly enhanced analysts' confidence and accuracy in predictions. The research also identified key features contributing to financial trends, aiding better decision-making. These findings advocate for the development of interpretable AI models to improve their acceptance and utility in financial forecasting.
