Autonomous vehicles (AVs) driven by artificial intelligence (AI) promise safer and more efficient transportation. However, the ethical implications of AI decision-making in traffic scenarios need further exploration. By simulating complex traffic situations, we evaluated how AI-driven AVs balance safety and efficiency. The study revealed that AI prioritizes minimizing collisions but often struggles with ethical dilemmas involving multiple road users. Incorporating ethical frameworks into AI decision-making improved outcomes and user acceptance. This research highlights the importance of ethical considerations in the development of AV technology.
