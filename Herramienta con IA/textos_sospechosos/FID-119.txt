The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational tools offers personalized learning experiences at scale. Yet, the emotional responsiveness of AI tutors on student engagement remains under-researched. Through controlled experiments in online learning environments, we assessed how empathetic AI tutors affect student motivation and performance. AI tutors that recognized and responded to student emotions led to higher engagement and improved academic outcomes. The study also highlighted the influence of cultural context on AI interaction. These findings suggest that emotionally intelligent AI can enhance educational experiences, promoting better learning outcomes.
