Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized healthcare diagnostics due to its accuracy and efficiency. However, the impact of AI's interpretability on diagnostic confidence has been underexplored. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we investigated how the transparency of AI diagnostic tools influences healthcare professionals' trust and decision-making. Transparent AI explanations significantly enhanced diagnostic confidence and reduced errors. The study also examined the role of user experience design in AI tools, finding that intuitive interfaces further bolstered trust. These insights underscore the necessity for explainable AI in healthcare, aiming to foster better clinical outcomes through enhanced trust and usability.
