While on the one hand the development of artificial intelligence had an increasingly important impact not only on the economic system, but also on people’s lives, opening up new scenarios, imposing new constraints, and giving rise to new opportunities, at the same time it was emerging as a further potential threat to humanity. We needed to abandon an approach based on an optimistic prejudice towards artificial intelligence, which was often presented as a panacea for all evils, with thaumaturgic properties that could be extended to all problems and situations. Artificial intelligence was a tool that had to be used with care and caution, also taking into account the possible risks involved, risks that would become all the greater the more powerful the calculation tools were. This was why the issue of ‘Machine Ethics’ was being forcefully raised at the scientific level.
