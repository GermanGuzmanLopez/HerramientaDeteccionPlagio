Artificial General Intelligence was the idea that someday a hypothetical agent would arise from artificial intelligence (AI) progresses, and would surpass by far the brightest and most gifted human minds. This idea had been around since the early development of AI. Since then, scenarios on how such AI might behave towards humans had been the subject of many fictional and research works. This paper analyzed the current state of artificial intelligence progresses, and how the current AI race with the ever faster release of impressive new AI methods (that could deceive humans, outperform them at tasks we thought impossible to tackle by AI a mere decade ago, and that disrupted the job market) had raised concerns that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) might be coming faster than we thought. In particular, we focused on 3 specific families of modern AIs to develop the idea that deep neural networks, which were the current backbone of nearly all artificial intelligence methods, were poor candidates for any AGI to arise due to their many limitations, and therefore that any threat coming from the recent AI race did not lie in AGI but in the limitations, uses, and lack of regulations of our current models and algorithms.
