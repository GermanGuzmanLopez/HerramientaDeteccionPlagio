Humans had certain social and emotional capabilities that helped them to interact with other human beings, one such capability was to recognize the other human's emotions. This capability enhanced human interactions to a great extent. As we moved towards the age of increasing Human-Machine Interaction systems, we had to strive to program our machines to achieve the so-called social and emotional capabilities algorithmically. A primary research frontier in emotion detection was recognizing it using facial images. Being able to recognize the emotions of a human being helped the machine adjust and tune itself to the human's needs and comfort. Emotion detection could be performed using various modalities such as video, audio, images, text, biometric information, etc. This study explored the emerging trends in emotion recognition through facial images. Automated recognition of emotions of people had the potential to predict psychiatric illness or other latent mental health issues.
