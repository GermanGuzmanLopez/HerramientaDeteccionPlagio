Artificial intelligence represents one of the latest technologies that imitates human intellect by enabling machines to think and act like humans. Autonomous vehicles are designed to operate independently, performing all necessary tasks without human intervention. This cutting-edge technology promises enhanced passenger safety, reduced road congestion, optimized traffic flow, decreased fuel usage, lower pollution levels, and improved travel experiences. Autonomous vehicles are crucial in various sectors including industry, agriculture, transportation, and military applications. These vehicles rely on sensor data and multiple artificial intelligence systems for their operations. The integration of artificial intelligence in autonomous vehicles involves data gathering, route planning, and execution, all of which require machine learning techniques. However, this advancement also raises privacy and security concerns. Ensuring the cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles is a major issue. This article will address the cybersecurity challenges associated with integrating artificial intelligence into autonomous vehicles, alongside the development of self-driving cars.
