Semantic features played a pivotal role in natural language processing, providing a deeper understanding of the meaning and context within textual data. In the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, semantic feature extraction involved translating linguistic elements into numerical representations, often utilizing advanced techniques like word embeddings and deep learning models. The integration of semantic features enhanced the precision and context-awareness of language models, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis, document categorization, and information retrieval to operate with greater accuracy and relevance. The paper introduced a novel approach, Hierarchical Mandhami Optimized Semantic Feature Extraction (HMOSFE), designed to enhance semantic feature extraction from English sentences. The proposed HMOSFE model comprised fusion of hierarchical clustering and fuzzy-based feature extraction, HMOSFE aimed to capture intricate semantic relationships within sentences, providing nuanced insights into the underlying meaning of textual content. The model employed pre-trained word embeddings for term representation, calculated a similarity matrix using cosine similarity, and utilized hierarchical clustering for document grouping. Fuzzy logic contributed to assigning weights to features, enabling a more refined understanding of semantic significance. The paper presented comprehensive results, including semantic similarity estimations, clustering distances, and fuzzy memberships, demonstrating the effectiveness of HMOSFE across diverse documents.
