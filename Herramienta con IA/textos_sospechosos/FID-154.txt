This study provided a content analysis of studies aimed at disclosing how artificial intelligence (AI) had been applied to the education sector and exploring the potential research trends and challenges of AI in education. A total of 100 papers, including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytic papers, were selected from the education and educational research category of the Social Sciences Citation Index database from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for further investigation. However, the challenges in education caused by AI regarding inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical issues, were also proposed. The results provided insights into an overview of the AI used in the education domain, which helped to strengthen the theoretical foundation of AI in education and provided a promising channel for educators and AI engineers to carry out further collaborative research.
