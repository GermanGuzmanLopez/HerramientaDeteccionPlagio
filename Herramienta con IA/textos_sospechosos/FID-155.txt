This study investigated how automated adaptable learning (BSG) could improve business simulating games (BSG) and its transformation possibilities. The rapid increase of information, combined with the intricate nature of past company contexts, meant that classic BSG education techniques frequently failed to adequately prepare students for the difficulties they would face in everyday life. This study provided a revolutionary architecture that continually evolved learning paths, responses, and testing situations based on specific student progress and desires. It did this by utilizing modern artificial intelligence methods, including machine learning. This technique sought to maximize users' preservation of expertise, ability to make decisions, and capacity for creative thinking through tailoring their education. In summary, our study raised possibilities for better and more interesting educational opportunities throughout the modern age by adding to the continuing conversation about the relationship between AI, training, and corporate strategies.
