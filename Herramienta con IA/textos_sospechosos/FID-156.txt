Artificial intelligence (AI) service failures were inevitable in hospitality companies; thus, how AI service recovery retained customers was an issue that could not be ignored. This article focused on AI service recovery, abandoning the traditional “intelligence quotient” thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. Using four experimental scenarios, the results indicated that, in service recovery, a high-empathy AI response could increase customers’ continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust were sequential mediators in this process. Compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopted multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. This paper extended the field of AI service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of AI after service failure. It also moved beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and revealed the importance of using AI emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in AI service recovery. Finally, it provided a useful tool for resolving AI service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which was of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of AI services.
