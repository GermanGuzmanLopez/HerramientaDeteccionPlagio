Automated dialogue systems were important applications of artificial intelligence, and traditional systems struggled to understand user emotions and provide empathetic feedback. This study integrated emotional intelligence technology into automated dialogue systems and created a dialogue generation model with emotional intelligence through deep learning and natural language processing techniques. The model could detect and understand a wide range of emotions and specific pain signals in real time, enabling the system to provide empathetic interaction. By integrating the results of the study "Can artificial intelligence detect pain and express pain empathy?", the model's ability to understand the subtle elements of pain empathy was enhanced, setting higher standards for emotional intelligence dialogue systems. The project aimed to provide theoretical understanding and practical suggestions to integrate advanced emotional intelligence capabilities into dialogue systems, thereby improving user experience and interaction quality.
