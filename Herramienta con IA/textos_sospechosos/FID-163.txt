Artificial intelligence is one of the emerging technologies that simulate human intelligence in machines by programming it to think like human beings and mimic their actions. An autonomous vehicle can function itself and carry out necessary functions without any human involvement. This innovative technology may provide increased passenger safety, less congested roads, congestion reduction, optimum traffic, lower fuel consumption, less pollution, and better travel experiences. Autonomous vehicles play a vital role in industry, agriculture, transportation, and military applications. The autonomous vehicle's activities are supported by sensor data and a few artificial intelligence systems.
