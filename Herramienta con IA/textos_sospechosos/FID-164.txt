Facial recognition is a well-established and popular field in Computer Vision, especially with advancements in deep learning and data sets. Deep facial recognition has made significant progress and is widely applied in real-world scenarios. A complete facial recognition system involves three main components: facial recognition, orientation, and representation. This system detects faces, aligns them to a standard view, and extracts features for recognition using deep convolutional neural networks. This article provides a detailed overview of the latest advancements in these areas, showing how deep learning has greatly enhanced their abilities. Object detection in machine vision is a challenging area that requires significant improvements.
