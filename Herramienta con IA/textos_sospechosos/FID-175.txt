Dynamic Virtual Reality (VR) has revolutionized gaming and entertainment industries by providing immersive experiences that take users to new locations. This study presents a novel and exciting idea called virtual reality horror sports, which combines aspects of horror with sports in the VR medium. We provide a unique method for determining a player's specific fears via game data and machine learning methods and an adaptive game system that employs agents to monitor players' terror experiences and restrict exposure to components that they find upsetting. Additional evidence from user studies and statistical significance testing suggests that our method may boost the stress and anxiety felt by gamers, resulting in a rewarding gaming experience. When VR, horror, and sports are all brought together, the outcome may compel and absorbing entertainment experience. Players will be immersed in a virtual environment that is both realistic and exciting.
