Measures of success for facial feminization surgery (FFS) have previously included improved rates of external gender perception as female and patient-reported outcome measures. In this study, we used artificial intelligence facial recognition software to objectively evaluate the effects of FFS on both perceived gender and age among male-to-female transgender patients, as well as their relationship with patient facial satisfaction. Preoperatively, FFS images were perceived as female 48.1% of the time, and postoperatively, this improved to 74.1% (P=0.05). FFS was associated with a decrease in perceived age relative to the patientâ€™s true age (-2.4 y, P<0.001), with older patients experiencing greater reductions. Pearson correlation matrix found no significant relationship between improved female gender typing and patient facial satisfaction. Undergoing surgery at a younger age was associated with higher overall facial satisfaction (r=-0.6, P=0.01).
