Artificial intelligence and robotics present various social, pedagogical, practical, ethical, and social justice challenges in adapting to changes in educational methods. After examining discussions and examples of artificial intelligence in education, particularly in primary school settings, I will concentrate on the actual implications of this significant educational challenge. Clearly, with these technological advancements, there is a risk of creating or exacerbating inequalities among social groups if equal access is not ensured. I will highlight the potential for personalizing learning pathways by detailing primary school initiatives aimed at fostering effective and collaborative communication skills to recognize, identify, and prevent factors impacting learning disorders. Lastly, drawing an analogy with the development of classical literacy (reading/writing), I will discuss the necessity of proposing artificial intelligence and robotics literacy courses for teachers so that these technologies can be more widely utilized across different age groups and grades.}
