\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In this first installment of the series on Artificial Intelligence in Cancer Clinical Research, it is crucial to define the concept of intelligence and the key attributes we associate with human intelligence. Intelligence is a construct we mostly link with human beings, encompassing our understanding of perception, cognition, thought, conceptualization, pattern recognition, symbolic processing, creativity, and problem-solving. Although we recognize elements of intelligence in other living species, we predominantly view intelligence as an expression of our conscious awareness and our ability to form concepts, engage in symbolic processing, develop language, and ultimately, reason, make decisions, and exercise judgment as we navigate our world. Meanwhile, consciousness and self-awareness, which seem fundamental and unique to human experience, remain profound and elusive mysteries. How can the intricate network of neurons in the central nervous system and the complex arrangement of atoms and molecules that adhere to the physical laws of motion result in our internal conscious experience, enabling us to think and reason, and experience emotions like joy, sadness, love, and beauty? While machine learning (ML) might be able to mimic conceptual processes, the human intellect can generate new, abstract concepts that further organize one's environment and discover abstract ideas. These processes provide new insights beyond the tangible world, creating a realm of meaningful symbolic systems driven by an active curiosity seeking to understand the world around us. While a sign denotes a characteristic of the external world that can be analyzed algorithmically, a symbol evokes an internal response separate from any specific concrete event. Human symbolic systems facilitate not only the communication of cognitive information through language but also the expression of emotional information. Many of humanity\'92s most significant qualities stem from the creative use of symbolic systems, which lead to the development of culture, myth, idealism, and empathy. While a sign is a context-free characteristic of an object or situation, a symbol pertains to internal experiences that gain meaning through the interplay of our prior experiences and memories with the current situation, generating emotions as we actively participate in shaping our world.}
