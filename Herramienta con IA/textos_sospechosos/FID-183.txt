\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 This article examines the potential dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) and argues for its cessation. Although AI provides numerous benefits, such as enhancing energy solutions and improving information accessibility, the negative consequences surpass the short-term advantages. The author points out past missed opportunities to prevent the adverse impacts of technologies like automobiles and toxic chemicals. The article explores various risks associated with AI, including extreme genetic engineering, threats to the financial system, lethal autonomous weapons, economic inequality, environmental impact, and the erosion of human relationships. The author advocates for a complete ban on AI, suggesting that it could lead to a reevaluation of neoliberal capitalism and the need to address other existential threats.}
