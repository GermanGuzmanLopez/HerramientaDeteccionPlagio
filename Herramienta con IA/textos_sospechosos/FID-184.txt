The motivation behind this issue is that many meetings have taken place in the past, where participants took group photos. The meetings provided only a corresponding name list of participants without one-to-one labels. In the worst-case scenario, the group photo might include faces of individuals who did not participate in the meeting. Another reason for asymmetric face recognition is that some meeting attendees did not appear in photos because they were assisting in taking pictures. This paper introduces an asymmetric face recognition mechanism, referred to as AFRM. Initially, AFRM uses the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect and extract all faces from photos. Next, AFRM extracts features from each face using the convolution feature map (Conv_FF) and uses these features to categorize the faces into different classes. Then, AFRM applies a statistic-based mechanism to map each name on the name list to each face class. According to this mapping, each face will be associated with one name. To quickly identify a face during the meeting, AFRM uses the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to represent the features of each face. During a new meeting, AFRM can extract the feature of one face and then use KNN to derive the features. Experimental results show that AFRM achieves more than 97% accuracy without requiring one-to-one name and face labeling.}
