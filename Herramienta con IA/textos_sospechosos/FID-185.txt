\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 This article examines the integration of Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Group Theory within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), revealing a transformative synergy that enhances the adaptability and robustness of intelligent systems. Starting with a separate analysis of Fuzzy Logic and Group Theory, the paper lays out the theoretical foundations for their integration. Fuzzy Logic's ability to manage uncertainty complements Group Theory's capability in uncovering structural insights, forming a unified framework. This integration is validated through various compelling case studies and experiments across different domains, including adaptive robotics control and healthcare decision support. These practical applications highlight the combined impact of FL and Group Theory, demonstrating improved adaptability, precision, and resilience in complex situations. The results not only reinforce the theoretical foundations but also provide concrete evidence of the integrated approach's potential. Looking ahead, the paper outlines key areas for further research, such as refining theoretical foundations, integrating with machine learning, and addressing scalability and explainability challenges. Ethical considerations, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and ongoing validation are emphasized as vital components in guiding the future of this interdisciplinary exploration.}
