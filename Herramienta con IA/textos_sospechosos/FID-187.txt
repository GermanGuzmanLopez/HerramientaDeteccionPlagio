These methods are termed "human-centric" because it is posited that humans are bound by the laws of thermodynamics to perceive the observable world in terms of FSS, where all processes within each FSS consist of a minimally reducible set of reversible operations or functions. These theoretical FSS are networks. In simulating physical processes, or processes in any other domain where the abstract functionality of systems can be represented as FSS, it is proposed that network effects could significantly or even exponentially enhance the general problem-solving capabilities of human groups. The objective of this monograph is to encourage exploration of how elements of these theories might align with emerging or established scientific concepts.}
