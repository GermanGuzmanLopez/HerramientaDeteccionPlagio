In applications where agents engage with users in interpersonal conversations, such as coaching, comfort, or behavior-change interventions, there is a growing need to understand the empathic capabilities of these agents. Currently, no tools exist to assess this. To understand empathic capabilities in interactive software agents, a precise notion of empathy is needed. The literature offers various definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus on a formal definition. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, a formal definition\'97an ontology\'97of empathy is developed. We demonstrate the potential of this formal definition in a controlled user study by using it to assess empathy in two advanced health and well-being chatbots: Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition captures the necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents and can uncover and explain trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. The definition, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), could serve as an automated tool, enabling systems to recognize empathy in interactions\'97whether it is an interactive agent evaluating its own empathic performance or an intelligent system assessing the empathic capability of its interlocutors.}
