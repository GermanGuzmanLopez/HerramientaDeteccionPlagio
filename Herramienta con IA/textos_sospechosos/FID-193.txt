\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Face recognition has recently garnered considerable attention as one of the most valuable image analysis applications. By leveraging their unique and remarkable identification capabilities, these systems can recognize users. Face recognition systems have been extensively researched. However, these systems have several drawbacks. Existing face recognition techniques may produce longer histograms, which can slow down performance on large-scale databases. To address the challenges associated with face recognition, we have proposed a hybrid descriptor combining MultiBlock Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). In this study, we employed the LTP, GLCM, and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) methods to extract illumination, rotation, and scale-invariant features from the face database images. These features were then trained using an Artificial Neural Network. The layer neurons were optimally selected using the Crow Search Optimization (CSO) method, resulting in an accuracy of 95%. The proposed approach was implemented using Matlab software, and the experimental data were analyzed to demonstrate that the developed texture descriptor achieves a higher recognition rate than existing methods.}
