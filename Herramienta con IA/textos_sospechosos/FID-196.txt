Fault detection technologies in the automotive industry are employed to identify potential or existing faults in automobiles, which typically encompass mechanical or electrical issues such as the airbag control unit, radiator, gearbox, transmission control unit, tire pressure, brakes, air conditioner, cylinder casket, alternator, and hub malfunctions, among others. Each fault manifests specific or related signs and symptoms. Various methods exist for detecting faults in automobiles, including binary logic techniques, fuzzy logic methods, and artificial intelligence techniques with different algorithms. In this research, we utilized a fuzzy logic-based technique employing the Mamdani Algorithm, which presented a superior fault detection mechanism. Ebrahim Mamdani proposed Mamdani\'92s algorithm as a fuzzy inference method with rule-bases that are more intuitive and easier to analyze and implement. This research employed web-based technology implemented using JavaScript, JQuery, SQL server, ASP.Net, Bootstrap 3.5, and CSS. The output of the system demonstrated significant improvement over other existing methods of fault detection in automobiles.}
