Early advancements in engineering, electronics, and various other fields have inspired AI. Several technologies are proposed for use in automated vehicles, contributing significantly to traffic optimization and casualty reduction. In the study of vehicle autonomy, two categories of development are available: high-level system integrations like new-energy vehicles and intelligent transportation systems, and the other involves backward subsystem advancement like sensors and information processing systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System demonstrates results that meet real-world expectations in vehicle autonomy. Situational intelligence, which gathers enormous amounts of data, is considered for high-definition creation of city maps, land surveying, and quality checking of roads. The transport's infotainment system covers driver's gesture recognition, language transaction, and perception of the surroundings with the assistance of cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) along with object localization in the scene. This chapter delves into the history of autonomous vehicles (AV), trending research areas of artificial intelligence technology in AV, state-of-the-art datasets used for AV research, and several Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) algorithms constituting the functioning of AV as a system, concluding with the challenges and opportunities of AI in AV.}
