\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Emotion recognition is the precise inference of human emotions from various sources and modalities, including questionnaires, physical signals, and physiological signals. Recently, emotion recognition has garnered attention due to its wide-ranging applications, such as affective computing, healthcare, human\'96robot interactions, and market research. This paper offers a comprehensive and systematic review of emotion recognition techniques from the current decade, encompassing both physical and physiological signals. Physical signals encompass speech and facial expression, while physiological signals include electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and eye tracking. The paper introduces various emotion models, stimuli for emotion elicitation, and the background of existing automated emotion recognition systems. It encompasses comprehensive searching and scanning of renowned datasets, followed by review design criteria. After thorough analysis and discussion, we identified 142 journal articles following PRISMA guidelines. The review provides a detailed analysis of existing studies and available datasets on emotion recognition, while also presenting potential challenges in the current literature and suggesting directions for future research.\
