This study integrates emotional intelligence technology into automated dialogue systems and creates a dialogue generation model with emotional intelligence using deep learning and natural language processing techniques. The model can detect and understand a wide range of emotions and specific pain signals in real time, enabling the system to provide empathetic interaction. By integrating findings from the study "Can artificial intelligence detect pain and express pain empathy?", the model's ability to understand the subtle elements of pain empathy is enhanced, setting higher standards for emotional intelligence dialogue systems. The project aims to offer theoretical understanding and practical suggestions to integrate advanced emotional intelligence capabilities into dialogue systems, thereby improving user experience and interaction quality.}
