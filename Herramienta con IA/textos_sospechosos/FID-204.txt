\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 To enhance the accuracy of personalized recommendations in artificial intelligence recommendation systems, this paper proposes a cross-domain information fusion matrix decomposition algorithm, addressing the challenges of inter-domain information fusion and data sparsity in collaborative filtering algorithms. Initially, Douban movie rating data and social network information are collected. Duplicate scores are removed using Levenshtein distance detection to ensure data integrity, while natural language processing technology extracts keywords and topic information from social texts. User relationships are converted into feature vectors using graph convolutional networks, and a unique thermal coding method converts discrete user and movie information into binary matrices. The Ridge regularization method is introduced to gradually optimize potential feature vectors to prevent overfitting. Features from different fields are integrated using weighted average and feature connection techniques. The paper combines the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm with merged user characteristics to generate personalized recommendation lists. During the experimental stage, cross-domain information fusion optimization is conducted on four mainstream mathematical matrix decomposition algorithms: alternating least squares method, non-negative matrix decomposition, singular value decomposition, and latent factor model (LFM). These algorithms are compared with the non-fused approach. Results indicate a significant improvement in score accuracy, with mean absolute error and root mean squared error reduced by 12.8% and 13.2% respectively across the four algorithms. Additionally, when k = 10, the average F1 score reaches 0.97, and the ranking accuracy coverage of the LFM algorithm increases by 54.2%. Overall, the mathematical matrix decomposition algorithm combined with cross-domain information fusion shows clear advantages in accuracy, prediction performance, recommendation diversity, and ranking quality. By effectively addressing collaborative filtering challenges through diverse techniques integration, it significantly surpasses traditional models in recommendation accuracy and variety.}
