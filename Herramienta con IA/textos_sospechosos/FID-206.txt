Essential for modern urban infrastructure, these systems provide sustainable and efficient lighting solutions. This paper presents the use of two prominent artificial intelligence methods, namely fuzzy logic and neural networks, for intelligent power control in public lighting networks. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of these approaches in optimizing power consumption and achieving efficient lighting, considering two parameters: road flow and weather conditions. By incorporating adaptive control mechanisms, these systems can dynamically respond to changing environmental conditions. To achieve this, the lighting system was modeled using the state flow tool in MATLAB/Simulink. Various algorithms based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were subsequently developed. Real data on traffic flow and cloud cover were used to train these algorithms. The integration of these real-world datasets ensures that the algorithms are robust and reliable under diverse conditions. Upon analysis of the simulation results, it was observed that, overall, algorithms based on neural networks yielded results closer to the algorithm based on fuzzy logic. This finding underscores the potential for neural network-based approaches to further enhance public lighting systems.}
