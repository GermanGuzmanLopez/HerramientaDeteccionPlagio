It could be argued that this infatuation with technology or \'91techno-philia\'92 in education has had a deep impact in the classroom changing the relationship between teacher and student, as well as between students; that is, these relations have become increasingly more I\'96It than I\'96Thou based because the capacity to form bonds, the level of connectedness between teacher and students, and between students has either decreased or become impaired by the increasing technologisation of education. The increasing integration of technology in education has altered traditional teacher-student dynamics, often reducing the depth of interpersonal connections. Running parallel to this and perhaps exacerbating the problem is the so-called process of \'91learnification\'92, which understands that teachers are mere facilitators of the learning process, rather than someone with an expertise who has something to teach others. This shift toward viewing teachers primarily as facilitators undermines their role as experts imparting knowledge. In this article, I first assess the current technologisation of education and the impact it has had in relations within the classroom; second, I characterise Buber\'92s I\'96It and I\'96Thou relations and its implications for education; finally, I investigate through a thought experiment if the development of AI could one day successfully replace human teachers in the classroom. I begin by evaluating how technology has reshaped classroom interactions, then I explore Buber's concepts of I\'96It and I\'96Thou relationships and their educational significance, and finally, I consider whether AI could feasibly substitute human teachers in the future.}
