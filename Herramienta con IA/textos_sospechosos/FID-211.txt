This innovative approach not only reduces energy consumption but also enhances the safety and comfort of urban environments. This paper presents the use of two prominent artificial intelligence methods, namely fuzzy logic and neural networks, for intelligent power control in public lighting networks. By incorporating real-time data analysis, the system can adapt to varying conditions more effectively. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of these approaches in optimizing power consumption and achieving efficient lighting, taking into consideration two parameters, namely road flow and weather conditions. Various algorithms based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were subsequently developed. To achieve this, the lighting system was modeled using the state flow tool in MATLAB/Simulink. Real data on traffic flow and cloud cover were utilized to train these algorithms. The training process involved extensive simulations to ensure accuracy and reliability. Upon analysis of the simulation results, it was observed that, overall, algorithms based on neural networks yielded results closer to the algorithm based on fuzzy logic. These findings highlight the potential for significant advancements in public lighting systems through the application of AI technologies.}
