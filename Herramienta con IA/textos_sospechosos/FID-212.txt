Methods: Seven participants with visual impairments and no prior experience with the two reading aids were involved. Among them, four participants had no light perception, while two individuals with measurable acuity and one with light perception were blindfolded for the tests. Performance was also evaluated under different text appearances and viewing conditions. Participants were asked to use the devices to complete 12 reading tasks that simulate daily activities. The study assessed the range of text attributes such as print size, contrast, and light level that allowed for successful reading. It also evaluated the ability to complete tasks with each device, measuring accuracy and completion time. Additionally, participants completed a survey about the two aids. Results: Both devices achieved over 95% accuracy in recognizing text from flat, plain word documents, but accuracy ranged from 13 to 57% for formatted text on curved surfaces. Both devices could read print sizes as small as 0.8M (equivalent to 20/40 Snellen, viewed at 40 cm). There was no significant difference in task completion time (p = .775). Participants successfully completed 71% of tasks with Orcam MyEye 1 and 55% with Seeing AI (p = .114). Participants believed both devices would be beneficial for daily activities. Discussion: Orcam MyEye 1 and Seeing AI exhibited similar capabilities in text reading and usability. Both aids were helpful for individuals with severe visual impairments in completing reading tasks. Implications for Practitioners: Choosing a reading device should be based on personal preferences and prior familiarity with the device, as neither solution showed clear superiority.}
