Recently, emotion recognition has gained attention because of its diverse application areas, like affective computing, healthcare, human\'96robot interactions, and market research. In recent years, emotion recognition has attracted significant interest due to its wide range of applications, such as affective computing, healthcare, human-robot interactions, and market research. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of emotion recognition techniques of the current decade. Physical signals involve speech and facial expression, while physiological signals include electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and eye tracking. The paper includes emotion recognition using physical and physiological signals. Physical signals include speech and facial expressions, whereas physiological signals comprise electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms, galvanic skin responses, and eye tracking. This paper offers an in-depth and systematic review of emotion recognition methods developed over the past ten years. This paper covers comprehensive searching and scanning of well-known datasets followed by design criteria for review. It involves extensive searching and analysis of well-known datasets, followed by design criteria for the review. The paper introduces different emotion models, stimuli for emotion elicitation, and the background of current automated emotion recognition systems. The paper provides an introduction to various emotion models, stimuli used for emotion elicitation, and the background of existing automated emotion recognition systems. Following a detailed analysis and discussion, 142 journal articles were selected in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. After a thorough analysis and discussion, we selected 142 journal articles using PRISMA guidelines. The review offers a thorough analysis of existing studies and available datasets related to emotion recognition. The review provides a detailed analysis of existing studies and available datasets of emotion recognition. Additionally, the review highlights potential challenges in the current literature and suggests directions for future research. Our review analysis also presented potential challenges in the existing literature and directions for future research.}
