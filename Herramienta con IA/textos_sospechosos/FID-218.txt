These expectations are frequently based on misunderstandings of current technical capabilities, a lack of knowledge about the latest AI developments in education, and overly narrow views on the roles of education in society. In this article, we review existing AI systems in education along with their pedagogical and educational assumptions. We establish a typology of AIED systems and describe various methods of applying AI in education and learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these methods are rooted in different interpretations of what AI and education can be, and discuss some potential obstacles on the path to AIED implementation.}
