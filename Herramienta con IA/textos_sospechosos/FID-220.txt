Advancements in digital computer technology have enabled the development of sophisticated imaging techniques, potentially impacting the interpretation of radiologic images. In mammography, these techniques have effectively detected and characterized abnormalities in digital images. In mammography, computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques have been used successfully to detect or to characterize abnormalities on digital images. Radiologists supplied with this information often perform better at mammographic detection or characterization tasks in observer studies than do unaided radiologists. Radiologists who use this information tend to outperform those who do not in mammographic detection and characterization tasks during observer studies. This technology therefore could decrease errors in mammographic interpretation that continue to plague human observers. As a result, this technology has the potential to reduce the errors in mammographic interpretation that human observers frequently encounter.}
