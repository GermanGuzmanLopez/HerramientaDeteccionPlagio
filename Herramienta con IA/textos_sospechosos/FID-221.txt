Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, e.g. expert system (ES), fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and biologically inspired (BI) had recently been applied widely in power electronics and motor drives. Each AI method had its own uniqueness and characteristics. Recently, researchers had developed a computational model of emotional learning in the mammalian brain, namely brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC). The results indicated the ability of BELBIC to control unknown non-linear dynamic systems. Therefore, the BELBIC could be easily adopted for niche mechatronics and industrial applications.
