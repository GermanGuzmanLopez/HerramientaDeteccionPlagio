This project was inspired by turn-based strategy games, Final Fantasy Tactics, X-Com 2, and modern turn-based strategy games. This project was structured around the use of artificial intelligence for storytelling within strategy games. The focus of this project utilized artificial intelligence in creating a quest generation system for storytelling. The resulting quest system created new quests dynamically after communicating with an artificial intelligence, allowing players to potentially experience an ever-expanding story from quests.
