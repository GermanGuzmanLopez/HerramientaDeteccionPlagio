This paper mainly discussed the asymmetric face recognition problem where the number of names in a name list and the number of faces in the photo might not have been equal, but each face should have been automatically labeled with a name. The motivation for this issue was that there had been many meetings in the past. After each meeting, the participants took group photos. The meeting provided only a corresponding name list of participants without one-to-one labels. In the worst case, the group photo might have mixed with the faces that were not participating in the meeting. Another reason for asymmetric face recognition was that some meeting personnel did not appear in photos because they assisted in taking pictures. This paper proposed an asymmetric face recognition mechanism, called AFRM in short. Initially, the proposed AFRM adopted the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect and extract all faces from photos. Next, AFRM extracted the features from each face using the convolution feature map (Conv_FF) and adopted the features to partition the faces into different classes. Then, the AFRM applied the statistic-based mechanism to map each name in the name list to each face class. According to this mapping, each face was associated with one name. To quickly identify a face during the meeting, the AFRM applied the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to represent the features of each face. During the new meeting, the proposed AFRM could extract the feature of one face and then adopted KNN to derive the features. Experimental results showed that the proposed mechanism achieved more than 97% accuracy without one-to-one name and face labeling.
