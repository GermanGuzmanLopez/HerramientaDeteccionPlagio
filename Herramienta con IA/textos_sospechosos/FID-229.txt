Recent innovations in Human-Centric Functional Modeling (HCFM) sought to represent natural phenomena in terms of graphs called “functional state spaces” or FSS that consisted of discrete states of functionality separated by the interactions through which regions of matter and/or antimatter transitioned from one state of functionality to another. These approaches were called “human-centric” because it was hypothesized that the human organism was constrained by the laws of thermodynamics to perceive the observable world in terms of FSS, where in each FSS all processes consisted of a minimally reducible set of reversible operations or functions. These hypothetical FSS were networks. In simulating physical processes, or processes in any other domain in which the abstract functionality of systems could be represented in terms of FSS, it was hypothesized that network effects created the potential to significantly or even exponentially increase the general problem-solving ability of human groups. The goal of this monograph was to encourage exploration of how components of these theories might align with emerging or established scientific concepts.
