Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) had generated great expectations for the future impact of AI in education and learning (AIED). Often these expectations had been based on misunderstandings of current technical possibilities, lack of knowledge about state-of-the-art AI in education, and exceedingly narrow views on the functions of education in society. In this article, we provided a review of existing AI systems in education and their pedagogic and educational assumptions. We developed a typology of AIED systems and described different ways of using AI in education and learning, showed how these were grounded in different interpretations of what AI and education were or could be, and discussed some potential roadblocks on the AIED highway.
