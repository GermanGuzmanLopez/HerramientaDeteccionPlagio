Research suggested that emotionally responsive machines that could simulate empathy increased the acceptance of users towards them, as the feeling of affinity towards the machine reduced negative perceptual feedback. In order to endow a robot with emotional intelligence, it had to be equipped with sensors capable of capturing users’ emotions (sense), appraising captured emotions to regulate its internal state (compute), and finally performing tasks where actions were regulated by the computed “emotional” state (act). However, despite the impressive progress made in recent years in terms of artificial intelligence, speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, and many other disciplines directly and indirectly related to artificial emotional recognition and behavior, we were still far from being able to endow robots with the empathic capabilities of a human being. This article aimed to give an overview of the implications of introducing emotional intelligence in robotic constructions by discussing recent advances in emotional intelligence in robotics.
