This study investigates how automated adaptable learning (BSG) can improve business simulating games (BSG) and their transformation possibilities. The rapid increase in information, combined with the intricate nature of today's business contexts, means that classic BSG education techniques often fail to adequately prepare students for the challenges they will face in everyday life. This study presents a revolutionary architecture that continuously evolves learning paths, responses, and testing situations based on specific student progress and desires. It achieves this by utilizing modern artificial intelligence methods, including machine learning. This approach aims to maximize users' retention of expertise, decision-making ability, and capacity for creative thinking through tailored education. In summary, our study contributes to the ongoing conversation about the relationship between AI, training, and corporate strategies, raising possibilities for better and more engaging educational opportunities in the modern age.
