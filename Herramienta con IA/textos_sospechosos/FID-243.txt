Agriculture is the ultimate imperative and primary source of origin to furnish domestic income for multifarious countries. The disease caused in plants due to various pathogens like viruses, fungi, and bacteria is responsible for considerable monetary losses in the agriculture sector worldwide. The security of crops concerning quality and quantity is crucial to monitor disease in plants. Thus, the recognition of plant disease is essential. The plant disease syndrome is noticeable in distinct parts of plants. Nonetheless, commonly the infection is detected in various leaves of plants. Computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques are utilized by various researchers to automatically identify diseases in plants via leaf images. These techniques also benefit farmers by enabling expeditious and appropriate actions to avoid a reduction in the quality and quantity of crops. The application of these techniques in the recognition of diseases can avert the disadvantage of erroneous selection of disease features, extraction of features, and boost the speed of technology and efficiency of research. Additionally, certain molecular techniques have been established to prevent and mitigate pathogenic threats. Hence, this review helps researchers to automatically detect diseases in plants using machine learning, deep learning, and few-shot learning, and provides certain diagnosis techniques to prevent diseases. Moreover, some future works in the classification of diseases are also discussed.
