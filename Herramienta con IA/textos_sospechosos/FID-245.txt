Dynamic Virtual Reality (VR) has revolutionized the gaming and entertainment industries by providing immersive experiences that transport users to new locations. This study presents a novel and exciting concept called virtual reality horror sports, which combines aspects of horror with sports in the VR medium. We propose a novel approach to developing adaptive VR horror games by combining player modeling approaches with an adaptive means-based system that learns about each player's individual fears and adjusts the game's content accordingly. This work introduces two significant advances: a unique method for determining a player's specific fears via game data and machine learning methods, and an adaptive game system that employs agents to monitor players' terror experiences and restrict exposure to components that they find upsetting. Additional evidence from user studies and statistical significance testing suggests that our method may enhance the stress and anxiety felt by gamers, resulting in a rewarding gaming experience. When VR, horror, and sports are all brought together, the outcome may compel and create an absorbing entertainment experience. Players will be immersed in a virtual environment that is both realistic and exciting. A dynamic virtual reality horror sports experience enhanced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and player modeling provides a novel and comprehensive form of entertainment by fusing physical activity, customization, and immersion in a single package. An endeavor of this kind has the potential to advance the state of VR and artificial intelligence in gaming while also offering exciting and memorable adventures for gamers.
