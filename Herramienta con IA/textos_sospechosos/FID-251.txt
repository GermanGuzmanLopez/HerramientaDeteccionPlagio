A defining aspect of our modern age was our tenacious belief in technology in all walks of life, not least in education. It could be argued that this infatuation with technology or ‘techno-philia’ in education had a deep impact in the classroom, changing the relationship between teacher and student, as well as between students; that is, these relations had become increasingly more I–It than I–Thou based because the capacity to form bonds, the level of connectedness between teacher and students, and between students had either decreased or become impaired by the increasing technologisation of education. Running parallel to this and perhaps exacerbating the problem was the so-called process of ‘learnification’, which understood that teachers were mere facilitators of the learning process, rather than experts who had something to teach others. In this article, I first assessed the current technologisation of education and the impact it had on relations within the classroom; second, I characterized Buber’s I–It and I–Thou relations and its implications for education; finally, I investigated through a thought experiment if the development of AI could one day successfully replace human teachers in the classroom.
