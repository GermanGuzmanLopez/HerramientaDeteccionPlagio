The world of artificial intelligence had changed drastically in the past 10 years, with the rise of deep learning bringing significant gains in a myriad of industrial and creative sectors. But what benefit could it provide for the video games industry? Game AI had been an established field for over 30 years, catering to the unique problems of the field, be it strategic opponents, non-player characters, gameplay pacing, and procedural content generation. This chapter highlighted the core areas where classical, symbolic AI continued to thrive and how machine learning was providing new alternatives to these established practices. Additionally, the chapter explored the new opportunities emerging courtesy of AI that were changing how games were being made, including player modeling, graphical upscaling, animation controllers, and automated testing.
