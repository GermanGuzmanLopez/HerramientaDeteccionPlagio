Due to the advancement and complexity of modern automobiles, fault detection had gone beyond manual or trial-and-error methods. The fault detection technologies in the automotive industry were used to identify any potential or already existing faults in automobiles. Faults in automobiles were usually mechanical or electrical faults that could include the airbag control unit, radiator, gearbox, transmission control unit, tire pressure, brakes, air conditioner, cylinder gasket, alternator, hubs malfunctions, etc. Each fault had specific or related signs and symptoms. There were several methods of fault detection in automobiles, such as the binary logic technique, the fuzzy logic method technique, and the artificial intelligence technique with different algorithms. In this research work, we employed a fuzzy logic-based technique that used a Mamdani Algorithm, which presented a better fault detection mechanism. Mamdani’s algorithm was proposed by Ebrahim Mamdani as a fuzzy inference method that had rule bases that were more intuitive and easier to analyze and implement. Mamdani’s algorithm produced fuzzy sets that originated from the fuzzy inference system’s output membership function for decision-making. This research work was a web-based technology implemented using JavaScript, JQuery, and SQL Server, ASP.Net, Bootstrap 3.5, and CSS. The output of the system showed a greater improvement over other existing methods of fault detection in automobiles.
