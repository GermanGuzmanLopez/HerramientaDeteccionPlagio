With the rise of deep neural networks, the performance of biometric systems increased tremendously. Biometric systems for face recognition became widely used in everyday life, such as in border control, crime prevention, or personal device access control. Although the accuracy of face recognition systems was generally high, they were not without flaws. Many biometric systems were found to exhibit demographic bias, resulting in different demographic groups not being recognized with the same accuracy. This was especially true for facial recognition due to demographic factors such as gender and skin color. While many previous works already reported demographic bias, this work aimed to reduce demographic bias for biometric face recognition applications. In this regard, 12 face recognition systems were benchmarked regarding biometric recognition performance as well as demographic differentials, i.e., fairness. Subsequently, multiple fusion techniques were applied with the goal of improving fairness in contrast to single systems. The experimental results showed that it was possible to improve fairness regarding single demographics, such as skin color or gender, while improving fairness for demographic subgroups turned out to be more challenging.
