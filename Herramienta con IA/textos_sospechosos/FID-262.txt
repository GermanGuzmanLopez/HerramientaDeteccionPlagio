As of the year 2021, over 30 nations have introduced their own national strategies concerning artificial intelligence (AI). These documents outline strategies and expectations regarding the impact of AI across various policy sectors, including education, and commonly discuss the social and ethical ramifications of AI. This analysis delves into 24 such national strategies, examining the role of education in the global discourse on AI policy. It discovers that discussions on the use of AI in education (AIED) are largely absent from policy dialogues, while there is a strong emphasis on the instrumental value of education in fostering an AI-prepared workforce and cultivating more AI experts. Moreover, despite the prevalent discussion on AI ethics, the ethical considerations of AIED receive minimal attention, indicating that the broader policy and ethical implications of AIED have not gained mainstream attention or the attention of key decision-makers, which is concerning given the inherent link between effective policy and ethical deliberation, as argued in this analysis. In response to these findings, the analysis applies a framework of five AI ethics principles to explore ways in which policymakers can better integrate the implications of AIED. Additionally, it provides recommendations for AIED scholars on engaging with the policymaking process and conducting ethics and policy-oriented AIED research to influence policy discussions in favor of the public good.
