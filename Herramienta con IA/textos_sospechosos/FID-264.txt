Despite previous claims of high accuracies exceeding 95%, the actual performance of facial recognition systems has shown a significant decline under the more rigorous conditions encountered in forensic scenarios, dropping to as low as 65%. While these systems demonstrate impressive performance under ideal conditions, real-world forensic scenarios pose challenges that expose their limitations, indicating the need for further advancements to bridge this gap. Recent progress in machine learning and computer vision has propelled facial recognition systems to achieve accuracies surpassing human performance in controlled environments. However, our study underscores the superiority of fingerprint analysis in all aspects. To address this discrepancy, we conducted a comprehensive study using synthetic facial datasets and controlled facial lineups mimicking real-world forensic conditions. This approach allowed us to systematically evaluate facial recognition performance under various challenging scenarios. Utilizing both synthetic and real facial datasets, we assessed the accuracy of two widely used neural-based facial recognition systems. The potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing accuracy and expediting forensic investigations is highlighted as a significant outcome of our research.
