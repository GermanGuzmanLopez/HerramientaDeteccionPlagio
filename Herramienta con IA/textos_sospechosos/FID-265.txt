The accuracy rates previously touted, exceeding 95%, experienced a notable decline when subjected to the demanding conditions encountered in forensic scenarios, plummeting to as low as 65%. While facial recognition systems have showcased impressive performance under ideal conditions, our study underscores a significant decrease in accuracy when faced with the complexities and challenges typical of real-world forensic scenarios, emphasizing the need for further advancements to address this gap. Recent strides in machine learning and computer vision have demonstrated facial recognition systems achieving accuracies that surpass human performance in controlled settings; however, fingerprint analysis has proven to be more accurate in all aspects. To investigate this, we developed a large-scale synthetic facial dataset and designed controlled facial lineups mirroring conditions encountered in real forensic situations. This methodology allowed us to systematically evaluate facial recognition under various challenging real-world conditions. Using both synthetic and established datasets of actual faces, we assessed the accuracy of two widely employed neural-based facial recognition systems. Our research underscores the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance accuracy and expedite the investigative process.
