While the core aim of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research is to support student learning, insights from other AI domains suggest that ethical intentions alone may not suffice. It is imperative to explicitly address issues such as fairness, accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency, and inclusion. Moreover, there is a need to distinguish between ethical actions and ethical practices, make pedagogical choices that are ethically sound, and anticipate unintended consequences. However, grappling with these and related issues is no simple task. As an initial step towards addressing this critical gap, we surveyed 60 leading researchers in the AIED community, inviting their responses on ethics and the application of AI in educational contexts. This paper outlines ethical concerns surrounding AI in education, summarizes the insights from 17 respondents, and delves into the complex issues they raised. Notably, it highlights that most AIED researchers lack training to confront emerging ethical questions. A well-designed framework for engaging with the ethics of AIED, incorporating a multidisciplinary approach and robust guidelines, appears essential in this context.
