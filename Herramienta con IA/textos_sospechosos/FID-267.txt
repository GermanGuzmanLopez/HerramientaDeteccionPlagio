Interactive software agents, like chatbots, are increasingly employed in the realm of health and well-being for activities such as coaching, comfort, or behavior-change interventions. However, understanding the empathic capabilities of these agents remains a challenge. Presently, there are no tools available for assessing agents' empathic capacities. To address this gap, a precise definition of empathy is essential. Drawing on a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, this study develops a formal definition—an ontology—of empathy. This definition is then tested in a controlled user-study, evaluating its efficacy in assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots: Replika and Wysa. The findings suggest that the developed definition captures necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents and elucidates trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. Implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), the definition holds promise as an automated tool for recognizing empathy in interactions.
