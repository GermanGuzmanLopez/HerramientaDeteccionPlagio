Research indicates that emotionally responsive machines capable of simulating empathy enhance user acceptance, as the sense of affinity towards the machine mitigates negative perceptual feedback. To imbue robots with emotional intelligence, they must be equipped with sensors capable of capturing users' emotions, appraising these emotions to regulate their internal states, and performing tasks where actions are guided by the computed emotional state. Despite significant progress in various disciplines related to artificial emotional recognition and behavior, such as artificial intelligence, speech recognition and synthesis, and computer vision, endowing robots with human-like empathic capabilities remains a distant goal. This article offers an overview of the implications of integrating emotional intelligence into robotic constructs, discussing recent advances in emotional intelligence in robotics.
