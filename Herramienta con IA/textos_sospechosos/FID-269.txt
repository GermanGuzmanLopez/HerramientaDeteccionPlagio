How would individuals allocate risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic scenarios? While existing literature on the ethics of AVs primarily focuses on moral judgments in inevitable collision scenarios, we advocate for extending this debate to driving behaviors in everyday road traffic, where ethical questions arise due to the redistribution of risk among road users. This redistribution raises pertinent ethical questions that cannot be addressed by simple heuristics like "hitting the brakes." Using an interactive, graphical representation of different traffic situations, we surveyed participants' preferences regarding driving maneuvers of AVs in a representative survey in Germany. Interestingly, participants' preferences extended beyond mere collision avoidance, with a willingness to take risks themselves for the benefit of other road users, suggesting a potential mitigation of the social dilemma of AVs in risky environments. Our research aims to foster constructive dialogue between engineers and philosophers on the ethics of AVs.
