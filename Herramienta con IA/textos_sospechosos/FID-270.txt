The recent shift towards delivering computing resources as a service represents a departure from traditional computing models, transitioning from purchasing computing as a product to accessing it as a service via the internet from large-scale data centers. However, with the emergence of cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), which are revolutionizing customer experience automation in various application areas like recommender systems (RS), there arises a need for modifications to support IoT devices, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard, and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). While numerous studies have explored FC applications, none have examined fog-based smart marketing domains like recommender systems. FC, a novel computational system, holds promise for mitigating latency and enhancing bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. The paper offers a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, using the intersection of FC and RS as an example. Our conceptualization of "fog-based recommender systems" presents novel avenues for academic research, as outlined in the latter part of this paper.
