This chapter explores the potential of digital technology to promote peacebuilding through education while acknowledging both the benefits and risks associated with its adoption. The authors propose an approach grounded in human-centered design (HCD), prioritizing the needs and perspectives of learners. Through three case studies, the chapter demonstrates the potential of digital storytelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and gaming to support peacebuilding efforts. The first case study examines digital storytelling's role in educating about genocide, while the second focuses on AI's role in protecting victims of violence. The third case study explores gaming's potential to raise awareness of war. Acknowledging the complexity of each technology, the authors advocate for an imaginative approach to explore the possibilities of liberatory design. The chapter underscores the importance of recognizing the ambivalent nature of technology and its potential to both fuel conflict and foster peacebuilding efforts.
