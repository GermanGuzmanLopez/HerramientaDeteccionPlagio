In recent years, advancements in science and technology, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine algorithms, have led to a transformation in the education system. Traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to teaching, which fail to consider individual learning styles and needs, are being replaced by personalized education systems optimized through machine learning algorithms. These systems offer tailored learning materials and recommendations based on students' learning history, interests, and abilities, thereby enhancing learning outcomes. Moreover, machine learning algorithms provide real-time feedback on student performance and adjust learning plans accordingly, making the learning process dynamic and personalized across various domains, including language learning, mathematics, and science. However, enhancing the efficiency of machine learning algorithms necessitates improvements in numerical optimization algorithms. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of existing machine learning algorithms optimizing personalized education recommendation systems, detailing the algorithm optimization process.
