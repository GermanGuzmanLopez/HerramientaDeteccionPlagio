Predicting winners in E-sports through real-time analytics holds the potential to further engage audiences during major tournament events. However, making such predictions in real-time poses challenges due to unpredictable variables within the game, including diverse player strategies and decision-making processes. This study endeavors to enhance audience engagement in video game tournaments by introducing a real-time prediction method. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTMs), our approach facilitates efficient predictions of win-lose outcomes using only the health indicator of each player as a time series. As a proof of concept, we evaluate our model's performance within a classic, two-player arcade game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo, benchmarking it against state-of-the-art methods for time series forecasting, such as Transformer models found in large language models (LLMs). Finally, we share our dataset and code in hopes of advancing predictive analysis for arcade games.
