Video games have become an integral part of many people's lives, evoking a wide range of emotions and creating deep immersion for players. This article introduces the concept of developing a system of dynamic procedural content generation (PCG) with game mechanics of interaction based on affective computing methods. To achieve this, an emotion recognition system based on fuzzy logic is developed, alongside PCG performed by Artificial Neural Networks. Emotion-based interaction in video games offers significant benefits in terms of enhancing player engagement, making a valuable contribution to human-computer interaction diversity.
