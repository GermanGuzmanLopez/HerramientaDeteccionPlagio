This paper addresses the challenge of asymmetric face recognition, where the number of names in a list and the number of faces in a photo may not match, yet each face must be automatically labeled with a name. This issue arises from scenarios where group photos are taken at meetings, with no individual labels provided. To tackle this, we propose an asymmetric face recognition mechanism (AFRM). Initially, AFRM employs the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect and extract all faces from photos. Subsequently, AFRM extracts features from each face using the convolution feature map (Conv_FF) and partitions faces into different classes based on these features. A statistical-based mechanism is then applied to map each name in the list to each face class, associating each face with a name. During new meetings, AFRM extracts the feature of a face and applies K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to derive features, facilitating quick face identification. Experimental results demonstrate AFRM's accuracy exceeding 97% without one-to-one name and face labeling.
