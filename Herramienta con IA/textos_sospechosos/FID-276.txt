Emotion recognition, the ability to accurately infer human emotions from various sources and modalities, has gained prominence due to its diverse applications in affective computing, healthcare, human-robot interactions, and market research. This paper provides a comprehensive review of emotion recognition techniques, covering physical and physiological signals. Physical signals encompass speech and facial expressions, while physiological signals include electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and eye tracking. The review includes an overview of emotion models, stimuli for emotion elicitation, and existing automated emotion recognition systems. By analyzing a vast array of studies and datasets, the review highlights potential challenges and directions for future research in emotion recognition.
