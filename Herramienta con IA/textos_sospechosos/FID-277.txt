The complexity of modern automobiles has rendered traditional fault detection methods obsolete. Fault detection technologies in the automotive industry are crucial for identifying potential or existing faults in vehicles, whether mechanical or electrical. These faults encompass various components such as airbag control units, radiators, gearboxes, tire pressure systems, brakes, air conditioners, cylinder gaskets, alternators, and hubs. Each fault exhibits specific signs and symptoms, necessitating tailored detection methods. This research employs a fuzzy logic-based technique utilizing the Mamdani Algorithm, which offers superior fault detection capabilities. The web-based implementation of this technique, using JavaScript, JQuery, SQL Server, ASP.Net, Bootstrap 3.5, and CSS, demonstrated enhanced fault detection compared to existing methods.
