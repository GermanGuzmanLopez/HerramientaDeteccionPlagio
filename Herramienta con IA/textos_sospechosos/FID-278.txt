In the present era, facial recognition technology (FRT) stands out as a remarkable innovation due to its capacity to identify individuals based on facial features. The global adoption of FRT has surged, particularly in response to the need for contactless biometric solutions following the COVID-19 pandemic. This technology, driven by artificial intelligence, has gained traction across various sectors, replacing traditional fingerprint scanners in applications ranging from security and surveillance to digital healthcare. Businesses worldwide are recognizing the immense commercial potential of FRT, emphasizing its pivotal role in authentication systems, access control, and photo retrieval. Despite its widespread adoption and commercial prospects, challenges and concerns surrounding FRT persist, especially concerning its performance in real-world forensic scenarios. While facial recognition systems have demonstrated high accuracy under controlled conditions, their effectiveness diminishes considerably in complex forensic situations. Bridging this accuracy gap remains a pressing concern, necessitating further advancements in machine learning and computer vision technologies. The study underscores the critical need for ongoing research and development to enhance the performance and reliability of facial recognition systems, especially in forensic applications where precision is paramount.
