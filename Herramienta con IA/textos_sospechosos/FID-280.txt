As modern automobiles become increasingly complex, fault detection methods have evolved beyond traditional manual approaches. Fault detection technologies in the automotive industry play a critical role in identifying potential or existing faults, be they mechanical or electrical. These faults encompass a range of components, including airbag control units, radiators, gearboxes, and tire pressure systems. Each fault exhibits unique signs and symptoms, necessitating specialized detection methods. This research leverages a fuzzy logic-based technique, specifically the Mamdani Algorithm, to enhance fault detection. Implemented as a web-based system using JavaScript, JQuery, SQL Server, ASP.Net, Bootstrap 3.5, and CSS, the proposed technique demonstrated superior fault detection capabilities compared to existing methods.
